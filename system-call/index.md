This discusses system calls from a userland point of view.
Kernel internals of system calls are not discussed here.

Tell your OS to do things which user space program can't do directly such as:

- write to stdout, stderr, files
- exit a program
- reboot your computer
- file io
- access devices
- process / threading threading management

All of those operations are ultra OS dependant,
so when possible one should use portable wrappers
libracies like ansi libc or the posix headers

It is highly recommended that you also understand
how to make system calls directly from assembler
to really understand them since they have a primary
assembly interface.

It is also possible to call them from c code via certain macros.

System call inerfaces have to be very stable

#linux

System calls available on one architechture may differ from those available on another architechture.

Most of the more commonly used ones are available on all architectures.

There are a bit more than 350 system calls available on all architecture, although individual
architectures can have many more. For example `alpha` has 505 syscalls as of 3.10-rc5.

Each system call gets a number in order of addition to the kernel:
this is called *syscall number*

This number can never be changed, but system calls may be declared deprecated.

To make any of the system calls, one must use the instruction `int $0x80`

`%eax` holds the syscall number

`%ebx`, `%ecx`, `%edx`, `%esx`, `%edi` are the params

#return value

The return value of the system call is put into eax when the system call is finished.

That is the only way for the sytem call to communiate directly with the calling process:
errno is TODO.

##errors

System calls can fail for much more reasons than is the case with userspace function,
since the kernel has to be careful and prevent processes from messing up the system.

In case of failure the program does not crash and no messages are printed:
it is up to the programmer to check that the syscall succeeded via its return value

By convention:

- most sytem calls return 0 on sucess, -1 on failure.

    In those cases, the main goal is not getting the actual return of the sytem call,
    but doing some side effect with it.

- some system calls can return positive integers in case of success,
    and -1 means failure.

    For example `write` returns the number of bytes writen if successful.

    Since this can never be negative, `-1` is used for errors.

- some system calls are always sucessful.

    This is the case for `getpid`, since all processes must have a PID,
    and any process has the prigiledge to view its own PID.

- getpriority is a special case, since for historical reasons the nice or a process
    is represented between -20 and 19.

    The solution is that the system call is simply shifted from 0 to 39.

    This is possible because the range of nice is small.

    Wrapper libraries such as POSIX may then convert this to the nice value between -20 and 19.

- a few system alls can return truly any positive or negative integers.

    This is the case for ptrace.

    In those cases, the sytem call returns the value via a pointer to a data.

    Then, on a higher level, glibc does:

            res = sys_ptrace(request, pid, addr, &data);
            if (res >= 0) {
                    errno = 0;
                    res = data;
            }
            return res;

    so that a user program has to do:

            errno = 0;
            res = ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKDATA, pid, addr, NULL);
            if (res == -1 && errno != 0)
                    /* error */

##errno

errno is an ANSI C and POSIX library level concept that does not exist on the system call level,

Itattempts to expose a simpler interface to user programs,
always returning `-1` on errors and using `errno` to identify the error.

System calls return only a single register value, and it is up to the syscall wrappers to tranform
that value into a proper return value and set `errno`.

Beaware that the `syscall` macro, while very low level syscall wrapper,
still does return value and errno setting manipulations just in a similar way to the POSIX error handling.

#get info on linux system calls

TODO where are the descriptions of what a system call does in official docs (in the kernel tree for ideally?)
    Bad / missing docs as for the rest of the API? Is man-pages official?

TODO how to get a list of syscalls available on all architectures without grepping/processing kernel code?

##man pages

TODO is the `man-pages` project official?

The man pages project documents the syscalls that are available on most archs
on their C interface.

Unfortunatelly they seem to describe an undiscernable mixture of POSIX APIs
and actual system calls. For example, `man 2 reboot` describes reboot which not a POSIX API
and therefore must be a system call, but `man 2 getpriority` says that it can return
negative values, which is not the case for the actual system call, which returns positive
values on the range 0 .. 39.

The entire section 2 of `man` is about system calls. You should check:

- `man 2 syscalls`: list of system calls available on *most* architectures

- `man 2 syscall`: a function that allows to make direct system calls in c

To get info on specific system calls do:

    man 2 write
    man 2 reboot

#create a new system call

This describes how to add a new system call.

This is specially useful if you want to find out exactly which system calls are available
for each arch.

As of 3.10-rc5, each arch seems to have a different internal organization for the location of its sytem calls on the source tree.

The necessary steps are:

- add to `asm/unistd.h` the `__NR_XXX` macros which define sytem call numbers.

    For example x86 puts it under: `arch/x86/include/asm`.

    Note that `unistd.h` may include other files according to the current architecture.
    For example on x86 unistd includes unistd_32 or unistd_64 depending on the configuration options.

##x86

#strace

List system calls made by executable.

Good way to investigate system calls.

Includes calls that load program.

    echo '#include <stdio.h>
    int main(void)
    { printf("hello"); return 0; }' > a.c

    gcc a.c
    strace ./a.out

#examples syscalls

this section shows system calls and what they do

required concepts needed to understand the sytem calls are also discussed here

##file descriptors

file descriptors contain know the position you are in the stream

file descriptors allow you to get/give data from anything outside ram:

- files
- devices (such as you mouse, keyboard, etc)

elated system calls are:

- open
- close
- write
- read

- get data to ram
- return no of bytes read if no error
- return error code if error
- increase position of fd

###lseek

cannot be done on pipes or sockets

##files and dirs

- getcwdprocesses have working info associated
- chdir
- fchdirusing a file descriptor instead of string
- chrootuse new root (default `/` ) for paths starting with `/`
- creatcreate file or device. TODO: what is a device
- mknodcreate a directory or special or ordinary file
- linkcreate new name for file
- unlinkdelete hardlink to file. If it is the last, deletes the file from system.
- mkdir
- rmdir
- rename
- accesscheck real user's permissions for a file
- chmod

- chown
