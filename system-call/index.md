tell your os to do things which user space program can't do directly such as:

- write to stdout, stderr, files
- access devices
- process/threading
- exit a program

all of those operations are ultra os dependant,
so when possible one should use portable wrappers
libracies like ansi libc or the posix headers

it is highly recommended that you also understand
how to make system calls directly from assembler
to really understand them since they have a primary
assembly interface

it is also possible to call them from c code via certain macros

# sources

- <http://syscalls.kernelgrok.com/>

    full linux syscal list

    links to the c manpages

    register args mnemonic

    links to online source code

- <http://www.lxhp.in-berlin.de/lhpsysc0.html>

    contains actual binary values of constants so you can make he calls from assembler

# linux

300+ total, many deprecated, some not implemented

each system call gets a number in order of addition to the kernel:
this is called *syscall number*

TODO: is the syscall number architecture specific?
or simply some architectures may implement a syscall while others don't?

this number can never be changed, but system calls may be declared deprecated.

system calls may be only present on certain architectures,
but most of them work on all architectures

to make any of the system calls, one must use the instruction `int $0x80`

`%eax` holds the syscall number

`%ebx`, `%ecx`, `%edx`, `%esx`, `%edi` are the params

## get info on linux system calls

the entire section 2 of `man` is about system calls. You should check:

- `man 2 syscalls`: list of system calls available on *most* architectures

    TODO how to get a list of *ALL* system calls

    TODO how to get a list of syscalls for each architecture?

- `man 2 syscall`: a function that allows to make direct system calls in c

to get info on specific system calls do:

    man 2 write

## examples of linux calls

this section shows system calls and what they do

required concepts needed to understand the sytem calls are also discussed here

### reboot

reboots or enables/disables ctrl+alt+del reboot

### file descriptors

file descriptors contain know the position you are in the stream

file descriptors allow you to get/give data from anything outside ram:

- files
- devices (such as you mouse, keyboard, etc)

elated system calls are:

- open
- close
- write
- read

- get data to ram
- return no of bytes read if no error
- return error code if error
- increase position of fd

#### lseek

reposition read/write

cannot be done on pipes or sockets

- dup
- dup2
- dup3
- fcntl

### files and dirs

- getcwdprocesses have working info associated
- chdir
- fchdirusing a file descriptor instead of string
- chrootuse new root (default `/` ) for paths starting with `/`
- creatcreate file or device. TODO: what is a device
- mknodcreate a directory or special or ordinary file
- linkcreate new name for file
- unlinkdelete hardlink to file. If it is the last, deletes the file from system.
- mkdir
- rmdir
- rename
- accesscheck real user's permissions for a file
- chmod

- chown
- fhownby file descriptor
- lchownno sym links

### sethostnameprocess have associated hostname info

### time

#### timesince January 1, 1970
#### stimeset system time
#### timesprocess and waitee for time
#### nanosleep
#### utimechange access and modification time of files

### threads

#### capget
#### capset
#### set_thread_area
#### get_thread_area
#### clone

creates thread: a process that can share open file descriptors and
memory

### process

#### exit
#### fork

creates process that is exact copy of current

open file descriptors TODO

#### execve

run process. does not return on sucess: old program ends

common combo: fork before, then execve

#### kill
#### waitpid
#### wait4
#### waitid
#### set_thread_area
#### priority

process have a priority number from -20 to 19

lower number means higher priority

##### nice
##### getpriority
##### setpriority

#### ptraceTODO ?

#### ids

every process has the following associated information:

##### real and effective useriddefaults to user who executed process
##### real and effective groupiddefaults to main group of user who executed process
##### supplementary group ids
##### parent id and parent groupdefaults to TODO effective or real of parent?

it is possible to change those values at runtime

##### getuid, setuid, geteuid, seteuid, setresuid, getresuid

get set

nothing = real

e = effective

res = real, effective and save all at once

##### getgroups setgroups

set suplementary group ids

##### parent process

every process has information about its parent's id

###### getppidprocess parent id
###### getpgidprocess group id

### data segment size

#### brkset
#### sbrkincrement. called if heap is not large enough on `malloc`

### mount
### umount

### ipc

#### signals

##### signal
##### sigactionhandler gets more info than with signal
##### sys_pausewait for signal
##### alarmsend alarm signal in n secs

#### futex

basis for semaphores and posix pthread mutexes

##### semaphores

shared integer resources that can be possessed and freed
indicating that other process may proceed

can be named or unnamed

in general each semaphore can have multiple values
(in real life they have 3!)

binary semaphore = a mutex

###### semget
###### semop
###### semtimedop
###### semctl

#### pipecreate pipe
#### pipe2pipe with flags

#### flockadvisory

file lock

#### sockets

main difference: can connect different computers!

##### accept
##### bind
##### socket
##### socketcall
##### socketpair
##### listen

#### shared memory

#### memory queues

TODO

### memory

#### cacheflush

flush instruction or data cache contents

#### getpagesize

get memory page size
