##dosbox

Some good games there

    cd
    mkdir dos
    dosbox game.exe

there are also `.bat` and `.com` executables

Inside the emulator

    mount c /home/$USER/dos
    c:
    dir
        #ls
    cd game
    game.exe

To avoid mounting every time, put under the `[autoexec]` section:

    echo -e "mount c /home/$USER/dos\nc:" >> ~/.dosbox/dosbox-*.conf
