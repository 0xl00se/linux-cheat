# proc filesystem

Offer access system information of user processes.

Files documented at:

    man proc

Some interesting files include:

-   numeric directories: `/proc/1/`, `/proc/2/`, ...:

    Contain standard directory structures with process info.

    This is why that dir is called `/proc`

-   `cat /proc/meminfo`: information on RAM memory

-   `cat /proc/modules`: information on modules

-   `cat /proc/mounts`: list all mounted filesystems and some info on them

-   `cat /proc/partitions`: `softirq` info

-   `cat /proc/sched_debug`: scheduler info for debugging

-   `cat /proc/self/`: information about the current process

-   `cat /proc/slabinfo`: slab allocator info

-   `cat /proc/softirqs`: `softirq` info

-   `cat /proc/version`: Linux kernel version and other system info. Similar to `uname -a` output.

-   `cat /proc/devices`: information on registered character and block devices.

    Does not consider files under `/dev/`, but registrations done for example via `alloc_chrdev_region`.

    Sample lines:

        Character devices:
        1 mem
        4 tty

    Which say that:

    - major number 1 is taken device named `mem`
    - major number 4 is taken device named `tty`

    where the device name is what was passed to the `alloc_chrdev_region` call.

-   `sudo cat /proc/kallsyms | less`: list of kernel symbols

    Sample output lines:

        c10010c0 t do_signal
        c1001980 T do_notify_resume
        ^        ^ ^
        1        2 3

    Fields:

    1. address
    2. type. Same as used by the `nm` utility.
    3. id

## cpuinfo

## /proc/cpuinfo

TODO vs `/sys/bus/cpu`.

`lscpu` gets information from this file.

On x86, most (TODO all?) of this information comes from the `CPUID` instruction.

Information on CPUs:

    cat /proc/cpuinfo

Sample output (only one of my 4 cores):

    processor       : 0
    vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
    cpu family      : 6

    power management:

- `processor`: processor ID, one for each core
- `vendor_id`: is part of CPU ID and identifies the vendor
- `family`, `model` and `stepping` come directly from `CPUID`. Stepping is just another smaller version level: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepping_level>.

### cpuinfo flags

Meaning of all flags: <http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43539/what-do-the-flags-in-proc-cpuinfo-mean>

The names come from several sources: some are vendor specific like Intel and AMD, others are Linux only keywords.

### Check if CPU is 64 bit

### lm

    cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags | grep lm

`lm` is a `CPUID` flag that stands for Long Mode and indicates exactly support for 64 bit.

## /proc/sys

Contains kernel parameters.

Those can also be modified with `sysctl`.

## /proc/uptime

How long the system has been up for.

Used by the procps `uptime` utility.

Sample output:

    6729.78 23034.43

## /proc/loadavg

## Load average

    cat /proc/loadavg

What percentage of the CPU time was used.

Sample output:

    0.25 0.20 0.23 1/699 10903
    ^    ^    ^    ^     ^
    1    2    3    4     5

Meaning:

-   1, 2, and 3: load average over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

    Sample values:

    - `1.0` all CPU time was used exactly.
    - `2.0` it would require 2 CPUs to handle the load. The wait queue got longer.

    This number does not consider how many CPU cores you have. E.g., if you have 4 cores, then you can handle a load average of `4.0`.

    A good rule of thumb is: keep it below `0.7`. If it goes over, start investigating before things start break.

-   4: TODO

-   5: PID of the last process created on the system.

Used by tools such as `top`, `uptime`.
