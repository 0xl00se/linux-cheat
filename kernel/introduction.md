# Introduction

Besides the Linux kernel, what most people call a Linux system, or more precisely a Linux distribution, must also contain many more user level basic services such as the python interpreter, the X server, etc. The extra user space services are specified by the LSB, and are not a part of the Linux kernel.

## License of the kernel

GPL.

This is fundamental because enterprises never give back unless they are forced to.

And 80% of the kernel is written by enterprises: <http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/linux-foundation/who-writes-linux-2015>

## What is the Kernel written in

The Linux kernel is written on mainly on C99 standard with GCC extensions, which it uses extensively, both on points which cannot be done in any other way without the extensions (inline assembly), but also at points where those are not strictly necessary, for example to improve debugging and performance.

The C code defines higher level interfaces, which must be implemented in assembly for each ISA.

You cannot use user space libs such as libc to program the kernel, since the kernel itself itself if need to be working for user space to work.

You cannot use floating point operations on kernel code because that would incur too much overhead of saving floating point registers on some architectures, so don't do it.

### clang to compile kernel

In 2010 clang supported enough GNU extensions to compile the kernel, and it is supported on the 4.0 Makefile. It can be selected with CC.

## Release cycle

## Version numbering

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#Version_numbering>

Since 2004: new release every 3 months.

Major releases are of type `3.x`.

Urgent security fixes may get a new minor as `3.x.y`.

Before a release, Linus announces feature freeze, and release candidates start being tagged as `3.x.rc1`, etc.

Patches are sent by email.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#Maintenance>

Top developers have their source under separate forks at: <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/> with possibly multiple feature branches.

### Backports

Most releases get 3 month backport support.

Every 1 year TODO check a long term support release comes out with 2 year support.

## What the kernel does

Summary: interface with different types of hardware to create the illusion of a simple unique POSIX API user-land prorams can rely on, e.g.: contiguous RAM memory, files, processes, user permissions, etc.

AKA magic.

If something has some kind of hardware support and is considered general enough, it is likely that the kernel will be involved.

Examples of operations:

-   **user permission control**

    The kernel determines what programs can do or not, enforcing for example file permissions.

-   **virtual address space**

    All programs see is a virtual address space from 0 to a max size, even if the physical memory may be split in a complex way in the physical RAM.

    If they try write out of this space, the kernel terminates them, so that they don't mess up with other process memory.

    This also increases portability across different memory devices and architectures.

-   **filesystem**

     The kernel abstracts individual filesystems into a simple directory file tree easily usable by any program, without considering the filesystem type or the hardware type (hd, flash device, floppy disk, etc.)

-   **concurrence**

    The kernel schedules programs one after another quite quickly and in a smart way, so that even users with a single processor can have the impression that they are running multiple applications at the same time, while in reality all they are doing is switching very quickly between applications.

-   **virtualization**

    The kernel can make a single system look like multiple systems, e.g. to allow code to be run in a well determined environment. The subsystem that does this is called LXC: `Linux Containers`, and is exploited in applications such as Docker.

But the kernel does much, much more:

-   **random number generation**: `/dev/urandom`

## POSIX compliance

Of of the goals of Linux is to highly (but to 100%) POSIX compliant.

Therefore, many of its system calls and concepts map directly to POSIX concepts.

We strongly encourage you to look at exactly what POSIX specifies and what it does not, so as to be able to decide if your code cannot be made more portable by using the POSIX C API instead of Linux specific code.

## Monolithic kernel

Linux adopted the monolithic kernel approach instead of the micro-kernel approach of MINIX on which it was based, and GNU HURD.

This proved to be a great decision, as micro-kernels are much harder to write, was one of the reasons why Linux won.

Andrew S. Tanenbaum who made MINIX said it was a bad choice in 92 in the famous Tanenbaum Torvalds debate: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate> <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.os.minix/wlhw16QWltI[1-25]>
