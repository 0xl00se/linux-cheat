#module description

##license

the kernel offers methods to indicate the license of modules or parts of modules
such as symbols

for entire modules, the `MODULE_LICENSE` macro can be used. Possible args:

- "GPL v2" (for GPL version two only)
- "GPL and additional rights"
- "Dual BSD/GPL"
- "Dual MPL/GPL"
- "Proprietary"

where `Dual` means that developers can either use BSD or GPL

If you don't set this, it is taken to be `Proprietary` by default,
'tainting' the module and the kernel,
so always define this if your module is not proprietary.

#parameters

parameters an be passed to modules at insertion time:

- via command line arguments for `insmod` and `modprobe`
- via conf files in `/etc/modprobe.d/` for `modprobe` only

they are used from inside the program via the module_param macro.

if no vaule is given for them, they remain unchanged

the following types are supported:

- bool
- invbool (returns the negation of bool)
- charp: character pointer
- int, long, short, uint, ulong, ushort

the third is the file permissions for the module representation under `/sys/module/<name>/parameters`:

- `S_IRUGO`: readonly
- `S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR`: writeable by sudo

		is a function that does what must be done in case of an interrupt,
		typically a message sent by hardware such as a mouse saying "hey I moved"

		it cannot be interrupted by other kernel process, so it should be real quick in its job
		and do only what is absolutelly essential

		typically the jobs it will do are:

		      - save the data from some buffer into RAM. this prevents small buffers from getting filled up.
		      - send an aknowledgment to the hardware that the interrupt was handled so the hardware can
		          //continue to send data for example

		what it typically should *not* do it to actually procees the data that was aquired
		this should be left for the bottom half.

	#request_irq

		this function tells the kernel to use a given interrupt function to deal with certain interrupts

		1. interrupt line. If non existent, will be created.

			this is a number the identifies each type of interrupt (ex: one from the mouse, one from the keyboard, etc.)

			it may be fixed for very traditional devices like the keyboard, but dynamic for most modern devices.

			TODO how to determine a dynamic line?

		2. interrupt handler function

		3. flags.

			- `IRQF_SHARED` means that multiple handlers will handle this line.

				when each one is registered it must use `IRQF_SHARED`

			- `IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM` tells the kernel to use timings of this interrupt to add entropy to the random number generator

				should only be done for things which are unpredictable in timing such as mouve moves of disk accesses,
				but not for regular things like a hardware clock

		4. name. Should be unique, allows for communication with the user via `/proc/irq` and `/proc/interrupts` TODO understand

		5. number that distinguishes between multiple irqs in the same line.

			therefore be unique across different irqs on the same line.

			Can be `NULL` if irq is not shared. TODO understand
