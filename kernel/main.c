##license

the kernel offers methods to indicate the license of modules or parts of modules
such as symbols

for entire modules, the `MODULE_LICENSE` macro can be used. Possible args:

- "GPL v2" (for GPL version two only)
- "GPL and additional rights"
- "Dual BSD/GPL"
- "Dual MPL/GPL"
- "Proprietary"

where `Dual` means that developers can either use BSD or GPL

If you don't set this, it is taken to be `Proprietary` by default,
'tainting' the module and the kernel,
so always define this if your module is not proprietary.

	#scheduling

		modern systems are preemptive: they can stop tasks to start another ones, and continue with the old task later

		a major reason for this is to give users the illusion that
		their text editor, compiler and music player can
		run at the same time even if they have a single cpu

		scheduling is chooshing which processes will run next

		the processes which stopped running is said to have been *preempted*

		the main difficulty is that switching between processes (called *context switch*)
		has a cost because if requires copying old memory out and putting new memory in.

		balancing this is a question throughput vs latency balace.

		- throughput is the total average performance. Constant context switches reduce it because they have a cost
		- latency is the time it takes to attend to new matters such as refreshing the screen for the user.
			Reducing latency means more context switches which means smaller throughput

		#state

			processes can be in one of the following states:

			- running: running
			- waiting: wants to run, but scheduler let another one run for now
			- sleeping: is waiting for an event before it can run
			- stopped: killed but is waiting for its parent to call wait and get exit status
			- zombie: has been killed, but parent also without calling wait

		#policy

			policy is the way of choosing which process will run next

			POSIX specifies some policies, Linux implements them and defines new ones

			policy in inherited by children processes

			#normal vs real time policies

				policies can be divided into two classes: normal and real time

				real time processes always have higher priority:
				whenever a real time process is runnable it runs instead of normal processes
				therefore they must be used with much care not to bog the system down

				the name real time policy is not very true: Linux does not absolutelly ensure
				that process will finish before some deadline.

				however, realtime processes are very priviledged,
				and in absense of other real time processes without even higher priorities,
				the processes will run as fast as the hardware can possibly run it.

		#priorities

			priorities are a measure of how important processes are,
			which defines how much cpu time
			they shall get relative to other processes

			there are 2 types of priority:

			- real time priority

				ranges from 0 to 99

				only applies to process with a real time scheduling policy

			- normal priorities

				ranges from -20 to 19

				only applies to proces with a normal scheduling policy

				also known as *nice value*. The name relates to the fact that higher nice values
				mean less priority, so the process is being nice to others and letting them run first.

				nice has an exponential meaning: each increase in nice value means that
				the relative importance of a process increases in 1.25.

			for both of them, lower numbers mean higher priority

			internally, both real time and normal priorities are represented on a single
			integer which ranges from 0 to 140:

			- real time processes are in the 0 - 99 range
			- normal processes are in the 100 - 140 range

			once again, the lower values correspond to the greater priorities

			priority is inherited by children processes

			#nice

				is the traditional name for normal priority,
				ranging from -20 (greater priority) to 19.

				an increase in 1 nice level means 10% more cpu power

		#normal policies

			#completelly fair scheduler

				all normal processes are currently dealt with internally by the *completelly fair scheduler* (CFS)

				the idea behind this scheduler is imagining a system where there are as many cpu's
				as there are processeimagining a system where there are as many cpu's as there are processes

				being fair means giving one processor for each processes

				what the CFS tries to do is to get as close to that behaviour as possible,
				even though the actual number of processors is much smaller.

			#normal scheduling policy

				represented by the `SCHED_NORMAL` define

			#batch scheduling prolicy

				represented by the `SCHED_BATCH` define

				gets lower priority than normal processes TODO exactly how much lower

			#idle scheduling prolicy

				the lowest priority possible

				processes with this policy only run when the system has absolutely

				represented by the `SCHED_IDLE` define

		#real time policies

			#fifo

				represented by the `SCHED_FIFO` define

				highes priority possible

				handled by the real time scheduler.

				the process with highest real time priority runs however much it wants

				it can only be interrupted by:

				- another real time processes with even higher priority becomes RUNNABLE
				- a SIGSTOP
				- a sched_yield() call
				- a blocking operation such as a pipe read which puts it to sleep

				therefore, lots of care must be taken because an infinite loop here
				can easily take down the system.

			#round robin

				represented by the `SCHED_RR` define

				processes run fixed ammounts of time proportional to their real time priority

				like turning around in a pie where each process has a slice proportional to
				it real time priority

				can only be preempted like fifo processes, except that it may also be preempted
				by other round robin processes

			TODO if there is a round robin and a fifo processes, who runs?

		#swapper process

			when there are no other processes to do,
			the scheduler chooses a (TODO dummy?) processes called *swapper process*

		#runqueues

			a runqueue is a list of processes that will be given cpu time
			in order which process will be activated.

			it is managed by schedulers, and is a central part of how the scheduler
			chooses which process to run next

			there is one runqueu per processor.
