# Module description

## License

the kernel offers methods to indicate the license of modules or parts of modules
such as symbols

for entire modules, the `MODULE_LICENSE` macro can be used. Possible args:

- "GPL v2" (for GPL version two only)
- "GPL and additional rights"
- "Dual BSD/GPL"
- "Dual MPL/GPL"
- "Proprietary"

where `Dual` means that developers can either use BSD or GPL

If you don't set this, it is taken to be `Proprietary` by default,
'tainting' the module and the kernel,
so always define this if your module is not proprietary.

#EXPORT_SYMBOL

	Defined in `include/linux/export.h`.

	When the a module gets inserted in to the kernel, it will want to interact with symbols present on the kernel,
	it will want to interact with symbols present on the kernel.

	This is not possible on normal executable ELF files, since those do not contain the symbol names.
	A special method is therefore needed, and that method relies on `EXPORT_SYMBOL`.

	Only symbols which the kernel exports via `EXPORT_SYMBOL` can be seen by modules.

	For example, the function `schedule()` is defined in `kernel/sched/core.c`
	and exported there via `EXPOT_SYMBOL(schedule)`.

	It is visible to modules at compile time becaues `include/linux/sched.h` declares it,
	but linking can only work because it was exported.

	Therefore only exported symbols are part of the API that the kernel gives modules.

	The same goes for if one module wants to access symbols of the other module.

	Only exported symbols can be accessed. Also, if one module requires symbols from another one,
	it should obviously have the other one as a dependence.

	The kernel of course cannot depend on symbols offered by modules since those may not be present.

	TODO0 understand how this works?

	The list of exported symbols is made available via the `proc` filesystem as:

	Pointers to functions which implement central parts of file related system calls
	such as open, read, write or close do on a given file.

	The functions inside `file_operations` are wrapped around inside the system calls,

	Defined under `include/inux/fs.h`.

	In most cases, `NULL` entries mean that any corresponding system calls will fail. Exceptions:

	- open and release: if NULL, always sucessful.

		Prototype:

			ssize_t read_infinte(struct file *filp, char __user *buf, size_t count, loff_t *off){

		See the `read` system call for how this is wrapped.

		- filp:	 file structure being read from

		- buf:	 user supplied buffer to write output to

		- count: maximum number of bytes that should be read.

			The supplied `buf` should be at least that large.

			TODO0 can assume `>0` ?

		- off:   current file offset.

			At return it should contain the new offset.

		- return value: number of bytes actually read.

			May not be equal to the number requested if the file ended
			or if there was too much data for a single read operation because of kernel limitations.

			May only be `0` if there is not more data to be read, or if an error ocurred.

	# process

		The kernel manages user processes and kernel processes, scheduling them with some algorithm

	# threads

		Threads are processes that share the same address space so they act on common variables.

	# current

		Macro that gives the `task_struct` representing the current process.

		Defined in `include/asm-generic/current.h` as `current_thread_info()->task`,
		which is finally defined for each arch under `asm/thread_info.h`.

		`current` is so important that `x86` Linux 3.10 reserves the unused `ESP` stack pointer
		only to point to the `task_struct` of the current task via:

			(current_stack_pointer & ~(THREAD_SIZE - 1));

		Note how `THREAD_SIZE - 1` is of the form: `00000FFF`, `~` makes it `FFFFF000`,
		so that only the top bits of `current_stack_pointer` (ESP) are considered.

	# filesystem

		mnemonic: fs

		Specifies exactly how data should be stored on the disk.

		You can have a different filesystem per partition.

		Linux abstracts over several hardwares and filesystem types to create a simple interface for programs

		That abstraction is called the virtual filesystem (VFS).

	# virtual filesystem

		aka VFS

		An abstraction over all filesystem types.

		Allows programs to use a single API for all types of block devices (HD, flash, DVD)

		To be supported, a filesystem has to implement this abstraction.

		The concepts of the VS are largely bijective with the ext filesystem family,
		since those are often used with Linux.

		Support for each individual filesystem type can be loaded on kernel memory as a module.

		The virtual filesystem has some similarities with RAM management because both deal with
		the retreival and modification of data, but there are a few important differences:

		- HDs data is persistent. If for example a poweroff happens in the middle of an operation,
			the disk could remain corrupted, while RAM data is thrown away at each poweroff.

		- HDs operations are *much* slower than RAM operations, because you have to wait for a magnetic
			disk to turn around and read heads to be positioned at exact locations in order to get
			your data.

		4 major structures model the virtual filesystem:

		- superblock
		- inode
		- dentry
		- file

		# inode struct

			Represents a file in the usual sense: a chunk of data on disk with medatada such as

			- filesize
			- timestamps.
			- superbloc owner

			Defined in `fs.h`.

			Interesting members:

				kuid_t i_uid; 			//uid
				kgid_t i_gid; 			//gid

				//cdev represents character devices
				//block_device and pipe_inode_info block devices and pipes
				//so only one of those can apply at a time, thus the union
				union {
					struct pipe_inode_info	*i_pipe;
					struct block_device	*i_bdev;
					struct cdev		*i_cdev;
				};

				dev_t i_rdev; //device numbers if this represents


		# file struct

			represents a file open for reading.

			serveral file structs can refer to a single inode

			it contains information such as:

			- current position in the file
			- mode (read only, read-write)

			located in `fs.h`:

			Interesting fields:

				umode_t i_mode;		 	//rwx
				loff_t f_pos; 			//current read/write position
				unsigned int f_flags; 		//file flags, such as O_RDONLY, O_NONBLOCK, and O_SYNC
				struct file_operations *f_op; 	//what file operations do
				void *private_data; 		//used to store any state information implementation may wish to use
				struct dentry *f_dentry; 	//associated dentry

		# umode_t

			Encodes file permissions and type (regular file, character device, etc.)
			for example for sytem calls.

			`umode_t` is defined in `include/linux/types.h`

			The possible values are defined under: `include/uapi/linux/stat.h`
			and coincide with the POSIX names when possible, for example `S_IRWXU`
			is for owner has rwx.

		# file io from the kernel

			It seems that it is a bad practice to do file creation / reading / writing from the kernel:
			<http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8110>

			One acceptable solution for certain cases is using a special filesystem such as the proc filesystem.

	# ext filesystem family

		Free sources:

		- http://www.virtualblueness.net/Ext2fs-overview/Ext2fs-overview-0.1.html

		Main versions used: ext2, ext3 and ext4.

	# block ext

		A *block* or *sector* is the minimal unit of data transfer.

		There are two types of blocks:

		- physical: the actual minimum data transfer unit supported by the hardware.

		- logical: a filesystem parameter. Can be configured at filesystem creation.

			Determines the actual minimal blocksize that the OS will allow.

			Must be a multipe of 2^10.

			In the Linux ext c implementation of ext2 this is represented on the `s_log_block_size`
			of the `superblock` struct `struct ext2_super_block`

		You can get both physical and logical block sizethose values on `sh` with `sudo parted -l`.

		Common values for logical block sizes are: 2^10, 2^11 and 2^12.

		If the system is expected to have a few large files,
		using larger block files will be more efficient.

		Traditionally, a block could only contain a single file.
		Therefore, a one byte file would occupy an entire block.

		There are preparations for allowing block fragmentation TODO what is their status?

		In any case, fragmenting blocks would necessarily mean that access to inner files
		would be slower.

	# disk layout

		Disk layout for ext2:

			| boot block | block group 0 | ... | block group ng |

		where:

		- nb is total number of block groups

		# boot block

			aka boot sector

			Fits into one block.

			The boot block is not managed by the filesystem,
			but its space must be reserved.

			There are two types of boot blocks:

			TODO difference between both, confirm all the following info:

			- master boot record (MBR):

				One at the very start of each hard disk.

				Contains two pieces of information:

				- code to boot the system
				- a partition table, which indicates where each partition starts.

			- volume boot record (VBR):

		# block group

			Each block groups is of type:

				| super block | group descriptor 0 | ... | group descriptor ng | data block bitmap |
				| inode bitmap | inode table 0 | ... | inode table ni | data block 0 | ... | data block ni |

			where:

			- nb is total number of block groups
			- ni is total number of inodes

			Each block must fit into one physical block.

			The data of each super block and of the bg group descriptors of each group block are the same
			on all group blocks.

			This redundance is done to:

			- keep metadata close to data to reduce the access time

			- reduce probability of disk corruption (TODO confirm this)

			# #super block

				Store global information about the entire filesystem.

				Represented in the Linux kernel by `struct ext2_superblock` under `linux/kernel/fs/ext2.h`

				This includes interesting fields such as:

				- s_inodes_count: number of inodes in entire filesystem.

				- s_blocks_count: size of the filesystem in blocks.

				- s_log_block_size: log 2 of the multiplier of 1024 of the logical block size.

					Ex: 0 means block size 1024, 1 means 2 x 1024.

				- s_blocks_per_group: number of blocks for each group

				- s_mtime: last mount time

				- s_wtime: time of latest write opertion

				- s_mount_count: number of times this has been mounted.

				- s_max_mnt_count: maximun number of times it can be mounted.

				- s_magic: major version number. Differentiates ext2 from ext3 and ext4.

				- s_minor_rev_level: minor version number

				- __u8[16] s_uuid: numerical identifier

				- char[16] s_volume_name: numerical unique identifier for filesystem

				- char[64] s_last_mounted: path where it was last mounted.

	# interrupt handler

		is a function that does what must be done in case of an interrupt,
		typically a message sent by hardware such as a mouse saying "hey I moved"

		It is not possible to sleep in an interrupt handler TODO why, so it should be real quick in its job
		and do only what is absolutelly essential.

		An interrupt handler can however he interruptd by another interrupt handler TODO check, this depends on line I think.

		Typically the jobs it will do are:

		      -   save the data from some buffer into RAM. this prevents small buffers from getting filled up.

		      -   send an aknowledgment to the hardware that the interrupt was handled so the hardware can
                  continue to send data for example

		What it typically should *not* do it to actually procees the data that was aquired
		this should be left for the bottom half.

		TODO x86 mechanism

		TODO following functions

		void  enable_irq(int irq);
		void  disable_irq(int irq);
		void  disable_irq_nosync(int irq);

		void  local_irq_save(unsigned long flags);
		void  local_irq_disable(void);

		void  local_irq_restore(unsigned long flags);
		void  local_irq_enable(void);

	# request_irq

		this function tells the kernel to use a given interrupt function to deal with certain interrupts

		1. interrupt line. If non existent, will be created.

			this is a number the identifies each type of interrupt (ex: one from the mouse, one from the keyboard, etc.)

			it may be fixed for very traditional devices like the keyboard, but dynamic for most modern devices.

			TODO how to determine a line dynamically?

		2. interrupt handler function

		3. flags.

			- `IRQF_SHARED` means that multiple handlers will handle this line.

				when each one is registered it must use `IRQF_SHARED`

			- `IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM` tells the kernel to use timings of this interrupt to add entropy to the random number generator

				should only be done for things which are unpredictable in timing such as mouve moves of disk accesses,
				but not for regular things like a hardware clock

		4. name. Should be unique, allows for communication with the user via `/proc/irq` and `/proc/interrupts` TODO understand

		5. number that distinguishes between multiple irqs in the same line.

			therefore be unique across different irqs on the same line.

			Can be `NULL` if irq is not shared. TODO understand

	# syscall

		See system calls.

	# system calls

		This covers system calls from a kernel internal point of view, not from userland point of view.

		You should first learn to use system calls from userspace before reading this.

		Systems calls run in a context that:

		- can preempt
		- can sleep
		- `current` give the `task_struct` of the calling process

		Arguments are passed on CPU registers. This simplifies things since program memory can be swapped of.

		# create a system call

			This describes how to add a new system call.

			This is specially useful if you want to find out exactly which system calls are available
			for each arch.

			The necessary steps are:

			- decare and define the system call using the `SYSCALL_DEFINE` family of macros.

			- inform the kerne that a function is a system call by registering it.

		# declaration and definition

			Syscalls inside the kernel are functions.

			System calls are defined by useing macros of the SYSCALL_DEFINE family
			to keep declarations uniform and portable.

			Those macros are defined under `include/linux/syscalls.h`.

			Those macros automaticaly add the prefix `sys_` to the actual function names
			of the sytem calls.

			To actually turn one of those functions into a system call it must be registered
			as a system call.

			# SYSCALL_DEFINE<nargs>

				Defined at `syscalls.h`.

				Expands to a system call declaration that takes `<nargs>` arguments.

				Sample usage:

					SYSCALL_DEFINE0(getpid) {
						return task_tgid_vnr(current); // returns current->tgid
					}

			# COMPAT_SYSCALL_DEFINExxx

				TODO0

			# location on the source tree

				Portable system calls can be implemented anywhere on the source tree,
				in the place that fits their purporse more closely.

				Syscalls that don't fit well in any existing category fall by default under: `kernel/sys.c`.

				You can easily find all system call definitions with:

					grep -R 'SYSCALL_DEFINE'

				or if you are looking for a specific system call, say `sys_read`, use:

					grep -ER 'SYSCALL_DEFINE..read'

		# registration

			This describes how to inform the kernel that a function is a system call.

			As of 3.10 each arch seems to have a different internal method for the registration of system calls.

			In general, one must add to `asm/unistd.h` the `__NR_XXX` macros which define sytem call numbers.

			For example x86 puts it under: `arch/x86/include/asm`.

			Note that `unistd.h` may include other files according to the current architecture.
			For example on x86 unistd includes either `unistd_32` or `unistd_64` depending on the configuration options,
			and it is those files that do the actual registration.

			# x86

				This arch includes both 32 and 64 bits to factor out common points.

				System call information is stored under:

					arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl
					arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl

				The arch specific unistd are generated by scripts from these files and stored under:

				arch/x86/include/generated/uapi/unistd_XXX.h

				x32 concept definition: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI

		# __NR_XXX

			For most architectures those macros are defined under `uapi/asm/unistd.h`.

			For x86, those macros are generated programatically from TODO0 and placed under:
			`include/generated/uapi/asm/unistd_XXX.h`.

	# __user

		Indicates that the following pointer comes from userspace.

		An example is the wrtie system call:

			asmlinkage long sys_write(unsigned int fd, const char __user *buf,
						size_t count);

		The buffer comes from user space.

		A typical place to use those is on system calls, where user supplied pointers
		must be read or written to such as the read system call.

		Rationale:

		- userspace programs can be outside of main memory at the time of calling

		- userspace programs are not to be trusted: they can make mistakes / malicious moves,
			and the pointer could be invalide, for example NULL, leading to a page fault in the kernel.
