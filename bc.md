POSIX

Simple interpreted language, calculator focus.

Cute toy language that only exists because it is POSIX =),
but is completely superseded by any modern interpreted language,
and only golfs very slightly better than Python.

C like syntax.

Features: variable definition, function definition, arrays, strings

Non features: string concatenation:

    [ `echo '1+1' | bc` = 2 ] || exit 1
