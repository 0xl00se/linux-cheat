Gnu Compiler Collection: NOT c compiler

it is a large frontend to several subprograms such as `as`, `cpp`

it currently compiles: C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, Ada, and Go

# g++ vs gcc

g++: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/172587/what-is-the-difference-between-g-and-gcc

most important:

1) g++ treats both .c and .cpp files as c++, since .c is backwards compatible with c++, it works
2) g++ links to (but does not include) stdlib automatically, gcc does not!

# executable formats

## elf

linux

superseeds ``.coff`` which superseeds ``a.out``

## mach-o

mac os

## pe

windows. current `.exe`s

# compilation steps

it is good to understand which steps are done towards compilation

only expanded macros with the c preprocessor:

    cpp a.c > a.i
    cpp b.c > b.i

different languages have different preprocessors

generate human readable assembly code:

    gcc -S a.i -o a.s
    gcc -S b.i -o b.s

specify format:

    gcc -masm=att -S a.c -o a.s
    gcc -masm=intel -S a.c -o a.s

default format: `att` which is historically what has larger gcc support

make machine code from assembly code:

    as -o a.o a.s
    as -o b.o b.s

this transforms human readable formats into binary object files

make machine code from c direcly:

    gcc -c a.c -o a.o
    gcc -c b.c -o b.o

all above steps in one

    ld -o ab.out a.o b.o

link object files into single executable

    gcc a.c b.c -o ab.out

does all above steps in one

if you use make, it is faster to genterate `.o`
and keep them, since if the source does not change,
make will not recompile the corresponding `.o`

# flags

## Wall

enables all warnings:

    gcc -Wall

ALWAYS USE IT

enables all warnings, except `unused-variable`:

    gcc -Wall -Wno-unused-variable

## std

std specifies version os the language to be used

disables gcc extensions that conflict with c standrad

    gcc -std=c90
    gcc -std=c99
    gcc -std=1x

`c11` will be the next version and is still being developed at the time of writting

## ansi

don't use this:

    gcc -ansi

implies the most recent `-std` which gnu considers is stable manner (not necessarily the latest)

changes with time, currently equals:

    gcc -std=c90

it is a bit confusing not to have a fixed version of the standard to comply to,
so don't use it

## pedantic

            gcc -std=c1x -pedantic

give warnings for code that does not comply with c1x standard
this does not mean *FULL* complience, but greatly increases complience
there is currently no full complience check in `gcc`

            gcc -std=c1x -pedantic-errors

give errors instead of warnings

## march

optimizes code to given cpu (arch is for archtecture)
may use instructions only available to given cpu

                gcc -march=native
optimize for currrent compiling machine
                gcc -march=i386
80386 instruction set. old, compatible, used on almost all desktops and laptops
                gcc -march=armv7
Arm v.7, used on mobiles today

## optimization

list possible optimizations for `-O`:

    gcc -Q -O --help=optimizers

the options:

- O0 : no speed optimization. This is the default
- O : -O1 basic speed optimization
- O2 : more than O1
- O3 : more than O2
- Og : optimize for debugging
- Os : optimize for size
- Ofast : optimize for speed more than O3, *even if it breaks standards*

best general code optimization method:

    gcc -O3 a.c -o a.out

always use this for production code.

## summary

always use this for production code:

    gcc -std=c99 -pedantic-errors -Wall -03 -march=native a.c

### other

do c90 + gcc extensions:

    gcc -std=gnu90

# c preprocessor

does things like:

- fetching `#include` files
- evaluating and expanding `#define` and `#ifdef` macros

before the compilation

the executable is called `cpp`

gcc uses it implicitly

## define command line

    gcc -DLINELENGTH=80 -DDEBUG c.c -o c

same as adding

    define LINELENGTH 80
    define DEBUG

to top of file

## include search path

    echo '' | cpp -v

look for sections:

- `include "..." search starts here`:
- `include <...> search starts here`:

## output preprocessed file

learing purposes only:

    gcc -E c.c -o c

does whatever the preprocessor must do and output it to a file

# cross compile

cross compiling means to compile a program for a different OS
or architecture than the one the compiler is running

gcc cannot cross compile for windows from linux (TODO check)

this can be done with mingw (TODO how)
