/*
cheat on gnu c extensions.

non gnu specific  features (ex: ansi c, posix) will not be put here.
the latest stable version of those standards will be considered.

you can disable all non gnu specific languages features with flags like `-ansi or -std=c99`

this will not however stop defining certain GNU specific preprocessor macros such as `__GNUC__`

obviously, it is always better if you avoid using those features,
but you may encounter them in linux specific projects, such as the linux kernel itself for example.

gnu extensions have a large chance of being implemented
in future ansi c versions (but sometimes in a modified form)
because of the large influence of gcc.

            - great intro: <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-ia/index.html>

        can be used if you really, really want to optimize at the cost of:

        - architecture dependance
        - tying you to gcc

        if you use this, do it like the linux kernel and separate different architecture
        code in different dirs.

        general syntax:

            asm (
                "movl %1, %%eax;"   //commands string
                "movl %%eax, %0;"
                : "=X" (y),   //outputs
                  "=X" (z)
                : "X" (x)    //inputs
                : "X" (x)
                : "%eax"     //clobbered registers
            );

        where:

        - commands: actual gas code into a single c string. Remember: each command has to end in newline or `;`.
        - outputs: start with `=`. gcc has to enforce is that at the end of the `asm` block that those values are set.
        - inputs:
        - clobbered registers:

            registers that may be modified explicitly in the assembly code.

            normally, users have no direct access to registers,
            so gcc is free to optimize by leaving values in those registers for later use.

            this tells gcc not to leave values in the listed since those may be modified.

            ex:

                mov $0, %eax

            clearly clobbers eax, so you would need to list eax in the clobber list.

            Note that certain instructions clobber registers
            even if they are not explicitly written in the code.

        both inputs and outputs are constrats. `X` will indicate the constraint type
