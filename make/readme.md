make allows you to:

- make command line interfaces of the type:

        make <something> a=b c=d

    *very* easily

- only build outputs when inputs have changed

    this may save lots of time when building large projects

it is the de facto standard tool for that today, but there is serious effort going on to replace it because it is too insane.
