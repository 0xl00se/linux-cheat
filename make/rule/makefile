##%

	#`%` equals the regex: `[^/]+`

	#it generates a rule only when the input files exists

	#or can be made by another rule

	#try:

	#- `make percent/a.elf`: 	a
	#- `make a.elf`:			no rule because no input (`%` does not do `/`)
	#- `make percent/b.elf`:	works because `b.c` is generated by another rule

percent/%.elf: percent/%.c
	@echo "percent/%.elf"
	#the `%` part:
	@echo "$*"

percent/b.c:
	touch percent/b.c

clean:
	percent/b.c
