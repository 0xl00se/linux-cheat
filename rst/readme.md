`docutils` is a python package for generating code documentation.

it contains a mojor specification of the `reStructuredTest`
and the reference implementations `rst2pdf` and `rst2html`.

while written in and mostly associated with python,
it can also be used to generate c/c++ docs, so i put it here.

install:

    sudo pip install docutils

docs: <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/index.html>
