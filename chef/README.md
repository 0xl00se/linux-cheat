Important terms:

-   chef-solo: version of the program that runs on a single computer.

    Reads local configuration files and modifies the system.

-   chef-client and chef-server: version of the program that runs in a client server system.

    Normally, the server offers configuration files requested by the client, which uses them to modify the system it runs on.
