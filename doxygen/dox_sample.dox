\page dox_sample Dox Sample

This is a sample of a `.dox` file.

`.dox` files can be used if you want to add general documentation to your project
that is not contained inside comments, for example a project main page,
in which case it is custumary to call it `mainpage.dox` or `Mainpage.dox`.

The text of a `.dox` file all goes inside a C++ like Doxygen comment.
