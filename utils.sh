##man

    #The manuals.

    #POSIX 7 specifies only the option `-k` and nothing about pages,
    #those are linux concepts.

    ##pages

        #The manual is organized into 7 pages.

        #When you install a new page, the developers decide where to put the documentation.

        #Every page has an intro section which says what it is about:

            man 2 intro
            man 3 intro

        #As in the case of the intro, you can distinguish ambiguities by giving the page number.

        #`write` system call:

            man 2 write

        #`write` shell command:

            man 1 write

        #List all entries of a page:

            man -k . | grep '(8)'

        #- 1: user commands (executables in path)

            #This is normally the largest section.

                man 1 passwd

        #- 2: system calls (c interface)

            #Those are *not* actual system calls, but portable low level system interfaces.

            #Most of the POSIX C library is here.

            #POSIX write function:

                man 2 write

        #- 3: library. system call wrappers.

            #Higher level than 2.

            #Distinction from `man 2` is hard to tell.

            #Contains for example:

            #- some POSIX apis like pthreads
            #- X11 APIs

        #- 4: special files such as device files

                man 4 zero
                man 4 random
                man 4 mouse

        #- 5: file formats specifications.

            #Examples:

            #/etc/passwd file syntax:

                man 5 passwd

            #elf executable format:

                man 5 elf

        #- 6: games

        #- 7: standards.

            #Contains standards summaries such as:

                man unicode
                man url
                man X

        #- 8: system administration

            #Commands that mostly only root can do.

            #Their binaries are typically under `/usr/sbin/`.

            #Examples:

                man 8 adduser
                man 8 grub-install
                man 8 mount

        ##versions

            #POSIX says that: A string to be written to standard output.

                #If the first operand is -n, or if any of the operands contain a <backslash> character,
                #the results are implementation-defined.

            #Which means that is your `echo` input statrs with `-n` or contains a backslash `\`,
            #behaviour is undetermined.

            #To make things worse, in practice different implementations *do* have different standards.

            #- On Ubuntu 13.04, `sh` has an `echo` built-in.

                #This version only accepts `-n` as a command line option,
                #and backslash escapes are always interpreted.

            #- `/bin/echo` by GNU. On Ubuntu 13.04, `bash` has no built-in called `echo`,
                #and therefore uses this one.

                #In this version, you need to use the `-e` option to activate the backslash escapes.

                #It seems that this is is slighltly *not* POSIX compliant since other options are introduced
                #such as `-e`, and POSIX seems to mandate that such strings be printed (`echo -e 'a' would print `-e a`)

            #The message then is clear: if you want to use escape chars, or ommit the ending newline,
            #do *not* use `echo`. Or even better, never use echo, only `printf`.

        #There are 2 main types of partitions: MBR or GPT

        ##MBR

            #You can only have 4 primary partitions.

            #Each one can be either divided into logical any number of logical partitions partitions.

            #Primary partitions get numbers from 1 to 4.

            #Logical partitions get numbers starting from 5.

            #You can visualise which partition is insde which disk with `sudo lsblk -l`.

            #TODO more common?

        ##GPT

            #Arbitrary ammount of primary partitions.

            #No logical partitions.

        #You should unmount partitions before making change to them.

        #To get info on partitions, start/end, filesystem type and flags,
        #consider: `parted`, `df -f`

    ##format disks

        #To format a disk is to prepare it for initial utilization, often destroying all data it contains.

        #Disk formatation consists mainly of two steps:

        #- create a partition table. This can be done with a tool such as `fdisk`.
        #- create a filesystem. This can be done with a tool from the mkfs.XXX family.

        #GUI tools such as gparted exist to make both those steps conveniently.

        #including those which are not mounted.

            #Operation: make a list of changes to be made, then write them all to disk and exit with `w` (write).

            #Most useful commands:

            #- m: list options
            #- p: print info on partition, same as using `-l` option.

    ##hard disks

        #Hard disks are represented by the system as block devices.

        #However, they have physical peculiarities which make their performance characteristics
        #different from block devices such as USB sticks.

        #The following parameters are relevant only to hard disks:

        #- sectors: smalles adressable memory in hd. you must get the whole sector at once.
        #- tracks
        #- cylinders
        #- heads

        #To understand those concepts, you must visualise the hard disk's physical arrangement:

        #- <http://osr507doc.sco.com/en/HANDBOOK/hdi_dkinit.html>
        #- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_%28disk_drive%29>

        #Those parameters can be gotten with commands such as `sudo fdisk -l`.

    ##filesystem

        #determines how data will get stored in the hard disk

        #ext2, ext3 and ext4 are the ones mainly used in linux today.

        #on ext4, only one dir is created at the root: lost+found

        #other important filesystems:

        #- ntfs: windows today
        #- nfat: dos
        #- mfs: Machintosh FileSystem. Mac OS X today.

        #to find out types see blkid or lsblk

        #each partition can have a different filesystem.

        #When creating partitions for external storage devices such as USB stick nowdays,
        #the best option is NTFS since Linux can read write to it out of the box, and it can be used on
        #the 95% of computers because they use Windows (which does not read / write to ext out of the box.)

    ##create filesystems

        #Find all commands to make filesystems:

            ls -l /sbin | grep mk

    ##uuid

        #Unique identifier for a partition. Field exists in ext and NTFS concept.

        #Given when you create of format a partition.

    ##blkid

        #Get UUID, label and filesystem type for all partitions

            sudo blkid

    ##label

        #An ext partitions concept.

    ##mount

        #Mounting is the operation of making a block device available for operations such as open, read and write.

        #This is what you must do before you can use devices such as USB.

        #Many modern distributions mount such devices automatically.

        #Linux has system calls dedicated to this operation.

        #The block device will be mounted on a directory in the filesystem,
        #and from then on shall be essentially indistinguishable from normal directories.
        #This directory is known as mount point.

        #If the directory was not empty, old contents will be hidden.

        #You can mount several times on the same point,
        #the last operation hiding the old mounted system
        #until the latest mounted system is unmounted.

        #You can mount with the mount utility, and unmount with the umount utility.

    ##mount util

        #Mount block device file on filesystem:

            sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/win/

        #List all mount points:

            sudo mount -l

        #Sample output:

            /dev/sda5 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)
            1            2      3     4

    ##umount

        #unmount what is on this dir

            sudo umount /media/win/

    ##bind

        #make one dir a copy of the other

            mkdir a
            mkdir b
            sudo mount --bind a b

            #It seems that fstab can auto create/remove the missing dirs.

        #3. Type. ext[234], ntfs, etc.

                umask=111,dmask=000

            #This way, dirs will be 000 and files 666 (not executable)

        ##dvd

            #Mounting dvds/usbs is similar to mounting partitions:

                /dev/cdrom 	/media/dvd 	noauto 	ro 0 0

            #However if you use auto, you always get errors when the dvd is empty.

    ##fuser

        #View which processes are using a device:

    ##nohup

        #POSIX 7

        ##application

            #make a process that continues to run if calling bash dies:

                exit

            #firefox still lives! it would be killed if it were not for nohup

        ##explanation

            #program ignores HUP (hangup) signal (signal is a linux os concept)

            #this signal is sent when the calling shell of a program is killed

            #most signals if uncaught (the case of most programs), kill the program

            #consequense: killing calling bash kills the program

            #*unless*, you use nohup

            #consequences of `nohup`:

            #- if stdin came from terminal (not pipe for example),
                #sdtin comes from `/dev/null` (you have no stdin!) instead

            #- if stdout would go to terminal (not pipe for example)
                #it is *appended to* `./nohup.out`, and if not possible from `$HOME/nohup.out`
                #instead
                #
                #if no stdout is generated, `nohup.out` is not created
                #
                #you can also redirect stdout to any file you want via `nohup cmd > file`
                #for example `nohup cmd > /dev/null` to ignore output
            #- the program is still visible in `jobs`, and may be killed with `kill %+`
            #- if you don't use `&`, it runs on foreground, preventing you from using bash

            #how to test all this:

                nohup bash -c 'for i in {1..10}; do echo $i; sleep 1; done'

            #try:

            #append `> f` to command
            #append `&`   to command

                jobs
                cat nohup.out

    ##timeout

        #run command for at most n seconds, and kill it if it does not finish in time

        #this works because in POSIX new processes are created exclusively
        #by forking from other processes, and parent information is stored
        #on each process, which dies if the parent dies

        #this is a very insightfull program to understand what happened after
        #the `init` process, first process on the system and common ancestor of all, started

        #particularaly interesting if you are on a graphical interface,
        #to understand where each process comes from

        #quotint `man pstree`, multiple processes with same name and parent are wrttin in short notation:

            #     |-getty
            #     |-getty
            #     `-getty

        #becomes:

            #init---4*[getty]

        #threads (run parallel, but on same data, and cannot fork) are indicated by brackets:

        #Such operations take a very long time, and are not viable on entire hard disks,

    ##xargs

        #posix 7

        #do some command on lots of files.

        #great for combo with find.

        ##alternatives

            #downsides of xargs:

            #- max number of arguments
            #- escaping madness for multiple commands

            #upsides of xargs:
            #- golfing!

            #in scripts, always use the more versatile (and slightly verbose) read while techinque:

                while read f; do
                    echo "$f";

        ##basic operation

            #read line from stdin, append as argument to the given command

            #does not automatically quote!

            #the default command is echo, which is basically useless

                echo $'a\nb' | xargs echo
                echo $'a\nb c' | xargs echo

            #empty lines are ignored:

                echo $'a\n\nb' | xargs

        ##-0

            #read up to nul char instead of newline char

            #allows for files with spaces, and even newlines!

                echo -en 'a\0b' | xargs -0

            #combo with `find -print0`:

                find . -print0 | xargs -0

        ##-I

            #allows you to put the argument anywhere and to quote it

                    echo $'a\nb' | xargs -I '{}' echo '{}'

        ##multiple commands

            #must use bash

            #only use this for very simple commands, or you are in for an escaping hell!

            #if you have to do this, use the read while technique instead

                    echo $'a\nb' | xargs -I '{}' bash -c "echo 1: '{}'; echo 2: '{}'"

        ##applications

                #useful when copying from linux to a system that does not accept
                #files that differ only by case (the case for MacOS and Windows)

                    find . | sort -f | uniq -di

                #remove them:

                    find . | sort -f | uniq -di | xargs -I'{}' rm '{}'

    ##locate

        #searchs for files in entire computer

        #prints all matches

        #this uses a database, which must be updated with updatedb before your new file is found

        #commonly, `updatedb` is a cronjob

        #match any substring in entire path:

            locate a
            locate /a

        #to force update of file cache, use updatedb

    ##which

        #prints full path of executable in path

        #very useful to understand where things are located

        #If you give it a sh builtin like `cd`, outputs nothing,
        #so this is a convenient test is something is a `sh` builtin or not.

        #Examples:

            which ls

            /bin/ls
