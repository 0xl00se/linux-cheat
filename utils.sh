##man

    #The manuals.

    #POSIX 7 specifies only the option `-k` and nothing about pages,
    #those are linux concepts.

    ##pages

        #The manual is organized into 7 pages.

        #When you install a new page, the developers decide where to put the documentation.

        #Every page has an intro section which says what it is about:

            man 2 intro
            man 3 intro

        #As in the case of the intro, you can distinguish ambiguities by giving the page number.

        #`write` system call:

            man 2 write

        #`write` shell command:

            man 1 write

        #List all entries of a page:

            man -k . | grep '(8)'

        #- 1: user commands (executables in path)

            #This is normally the largest section.

                man 1 passwd

        #- 2: system calls (c interface)

            #Those are *not* actual system calls, but portable low level system interfaces.

            #Most of the POSIX C library is here.

            #POSIX write function:

                man 2 write

        #- 3: library. system call wrappers.

            #Higher level than 2.

            #Distinction from `man 2` is hard to tell.

            #Contains for example:

            #- some POSIX apis like pthreads
            #- X11 APIs

        #- 4: special files such as device files

                man 4 zero
                man 4 random
                man 4 mouse

        #- 5: file formats specifications.

            #Examples:

            #/etc/passwd file syntax:

                man 5 passwd

            #elf executable format:

                man 5 elf

        #- 6: games

        #- 7: standards.

            #Contains standards summaries such as:

                man unicode
                man url
                man X

        #- 8: system administration

            #Commands that mostly only root can do.

            #Their binaries are typically under `/usr/sbin/`.

            #Examples:

                man 8 adduser
                man 8 grub-install
                man 8 mount

        ##sendmail

            # Interface that comes in multiple packages such as ssmtp and postfix,
            # so to configure it you must first determine which package provides it.

            # `sendmail` is an utility. Its interface is probably implemented
            # by other packages because that utility was widely used.

            # Simple SMTP.

            # Popular MTA. Really is simpler than Postfix to setup.

            # Configuration file:

                #vim /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf

            # Configurations to send an email from gmail:

                Root=your_email@gmail.com
                Mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:465

            # This is probably done so that email sending does not block the current session,
            # allowing in particular longer retry times.

            # To view the send queue, use `mailq`.

        ##versions

            #POSIX says that: A string to be written to standard output.

                #If the first operand is -n, or if any of the operands contain a <backslash> character,
                #the results are implementation-defined.

            #Which means that is your `echo` input statrs with `-n` or contains a backslash `\`,
            #behaviour is undetermined.

            #To make things worse, in practice different implementations *do* have different standards.

            #- On Ubuntu 13.04, `sh` has an `echo` built-in.

                #This version only accepts `-n` as a command line option,
                #and backslash escapes are always interpreted.

            #- `/bin/echo` by GNU. On Ubuntu 13.04, `bash` has no built-in called `echo`,
                #and therefore uses this one.

                #In this version, you need to use the `-e` option to activate the backslash escapes.

                #It seems that this is is slighltly *not* POSIX compliant since other options are introduced
                #such as `-e`, and POSIX seems to mandate that such strings be printed (`echo -e 'a' would print `-e a`)

            #The message then is clear: if you want to use escape chars, or ommit the ending newline,
            #do *not* use `echo`. Or even better, never use echo, only `printf`.

    ##partitions

        #There are 2 main types of partitions: MBR or GPT

        ##MBR

            #You can only have 4 primary partitions.

            #Each one can be either divided into logical any number of logical partitions partitions.

            #A primary parition that is split into logical paritions is called an extended partition.

            #Primary partitions get numbers from 1 to 4.

            #Logical partitions get numbers starting from 5.

            #You can visualise which partition is insde which disk with `sudo lsblk -l`.

            #TODO more common?

        ##GPT

            #Arbitrary ammount of primary partitions.

            #No logical partitions.

        #You should unmount partitions before making change to them.

        #To get info on partitions, start/end, filesystem type and flags,
        #consider: `parted`, `df -f`

    ##format disks

        #To format a disk is to prepare it for initial utilization, often destroying all data it contains.

        #Disk formatation consists mainly of two steps:

        #- create a partition table. This can be done with a tool such as `fdisk`.
        #- create a filesystem. This can be done with a tool from the mkfs.XXX family.

        #GUI tools such as gparted exist to make both those steps conveniently.

    ##lsblk

        #including those which are not mounted.

            #Edit partitions for sdb on REPL interface:

                sudo fdisk /dev/sdb

            #Operation: make a list of changes to be made, then write them all to disk and exit with `w` (write).

            #Most useful commands:

            #- m: list options
            #- p: print info on partition, same as using `-l` option.
            #- o: create new DOS partition table.
            #- n: create new partition.
            #- d: delete a partition.
            #- w: write enqueued changes and exit.

    ##hard disks

        #Hard disks are represented by the system as block devices.

        #However, they have physical peculiarities which make their performance characteristics
        #different from block devices such as USB sticks.

        #The following parameters are relevant only to hard disks:

        #- sectors: smalles adressable memory in hd. you must get the whole sector at once.
        #- tracks
        #- cylinders
        #- heads

        #To understand those concepts, you must visualise the hard disk's physical arrangement:

        #- <http://osr507doc.sco.com/en/HANDBOOK/hdi_dkinit.html>
        #- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_%28disk_drive%29>

        #Those parameters can be gotten with commands such as `sudo fdisk -l`.

    ##filesystem

        #determines how data will get stored in the hard disk

        #ext2, ext3 and ext4 are the ones mainly used in linux today.

        #on ext4, only one dir is created at the root: lost+found

        #other important filesystems:

        #- ntfs: windows today
        #- nfat: dos
        #- mfs: Machintosh FileSystem. Mac OS X today.

        #to find out types see blkid or lsblk

        #each partition can have a different filesystem.

        #When creating partitions for external storage devices such as USB stick nowdays,
        #the best option is NTFS since Linux can read write to it out of the box, and it can be used on
        #the 95% of computers because they use Windows (which does not read / write to ext out of the box.)

    ##create filesystems

        #Find all commands to make filesystems:

        # 1. partition type. hd: IDE (older). sb: SCSI (newer)
        # 2. hard disk identifier.
        # 3. parition number inside hard disk.

        # So on the example output given:

        # - 3 hds: had, sdb and hdc
        # - 1 and 3 are hd, 2 is sd
        # - 1 has 3 partitions

    ##uuid

        # Unique identifier for a partition. Field exists in ext and NTFS concept.

        # Given when you create of format a partition.

        # Can be found with tools such as lsblk, blkid or gparted.

        # Get UUID of a device:

            sudo lsblk -no UUID /dev/sda1

    ##blkid

        #Get UUID, label and filesystem type for all partitions

            sudo blkid

    ##label

        #An ext partitions concept.

        #Determines the mount name for the partition.

        #Should be unique, but not sure this is enforced. TODO

    ##e2label

        #sets new label for partition:

            sudo e2label /dev/sda7
            sudo e2label /dev/sda new_label

        #Each partition may have a label up to 16 chars length.
        #If it does, the partition will get that name when mounted.

    #list all labels:

        sudo blkid

    ##/dev/disk

        #symliks to partition identifiers

        #allows you to get identifier info

        #if id no present, link not there

        #Example:

            cd /dev/disk/
            ls -l
                #by-id
                #by-label

                #by-uuid

            ls -l by-id

    ##mount

        #Mounting is the operation of making a block device available for operations such as open, read and write.

        #This is what you must do before you can use devices such as USB.

        #Many modern distributions mount such devices automatically.

        #Linux has system calls dedicated to this operation.

        #The block device will be mounted on a directory in the filesystem,
        #and from then on shall be essentially indistinguishable from normal directories.
        #This directory is known as mount point.

        #If the directory was not empty, old contents will be hidden.

        #You can mount several times on the same point,
        #the last operation hiding the old mounted system
        #until the latest mounted system is unmounted.

        #You can mount with the mount utility, and unmount with the umount utility.

    ##mount util

        #Mount block device file on filesystem:

            sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/win/

        #List all mount points:

            sudo mount -l

        #Sample output:

            /dev/sda5 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)
            1            2      3     4

        #Shows:

        #1. device if any
        #2. mountpoint
        #3. type
        #4. flags

    ##umount

        #unmount what is on this dir

            sudo umount /media/win/

    ##bind

        #make one dir a copy of the other

            mkdir a
            mkdir b
            sudo mount --bind a b
            touch a/a
            touch b/b
            assert [ `ls a` = $'a\nb' ]
            assert [ `ls b` = $'a\nb' ]
            sudo umount b

        #2. where it will get mounted.

            #The most standard option is to make a subdir of `/media` like `/media/windows`.

            #This dir must exist before mount
            #and preferably be used only for mounting a single filesystem.

            #It seems that fstab can auto create/remove the missing dirs.

        #3. Type. ext[234], ntfs, etc.

        #see sources for others.

        ##auto mount windwos filesystems

            #To mount windows filesystems such as NTFS or DOS use:

                umask=111,dmask=000

            #This way, dirs will be 000 and files 666 (not executable)

        ##dvd

            #Mounting dvds/usbs is similar to mounting partitions:

                /dev/cdrom 	/media/dvd 	noauto 	ro 0 0

            #However if you use auto, you always get errors when the dvd is empty.

            #It is best to use auto, because dvd can be of several formats.

    ##fuser

        #View which processes are using a device:

        ulimit -f

    #Set value:

        ulimit -f 0

                #if several matches, ambiguous, and does nothing
            #- ?S	Invocation (command line) of job contains within it string S
            #- %%	"current" job (last job stopped in foreground or started in background)
            #- %+	"current" job (last job stopped in foreground or started in background)
            #- %-	last job

        #It is possible to use jobspecs directly with certain bash built-ins that could also take PID.
        #For example, to kill process by jobspec `%1`:

            #kill %1

        #Note that `kill` also usually exists as an external executable, and that the external executable
        #cannot kill by jobspec since this information is only known by bash itself.

        #able to write `kill %1`.

    ##kill

        #POSIX 7

        #Kill exists as a bash built-in.
        #One of the reasons for this is to allow users to `kill` by jobspec for example as `sleep 1- &; kill %1`,
        #which an external executable could not do. Killin gby PID is required by POSIX 7.

        #Send signals to a process. Signals are an ANSI C concept, with POSIX and Linux extensions.

        #Does not necessarily send SIGKILL, nor is SIGKILL the default signal sent!
        #The default signal it sends is SIGTERM.

        #It is unfortunatelly named kill because most signals end up killing process,
        #or also because the most used signal is SIGTERM generated by a C-C on the terminal.
        #which has the usual effect of killing a process.

        #List all signals available on the system:

            kill -l

        #lists numbers and descriptions.

        #Send SIGTERM signal to process:

            ps -A
            ID=
            kill $ID

        #SIGTERM is the default signal sent by `kill`.

        #Select by pid, found on ps for example.

        #Select by job-id found on jobs:

            sleep 10 &
            jobs
            kill %1

        #POSIX specifies this.

        #Send stop signal to process:

            kill -s SIGSTOP $ID
            kill -s sigstop $ID
            kill -s STOP $ID
            kill -s stop $ID

        #All of the above are specified by POSIX.

        #where `SIGSTOP` is the standard signal name.

        #Also possible with the XSI extension:

            kill -SIGSTOP $ID
            kill -sigstop $ID
            kill -STOP $ID
            kill -stop $ID

        #but not recommended because it is less uniform parameter passing,
        #and not guaranteed to be on all implementations.

    ##killall

        #Send signals to all process by name

        #psmisc package

        #Application: firefox/skype hanged. `ps -A | grep -i firef',
        #confirm that the name is firefox and that it is the only one with that name,
        #and then:

            killall firefox

        #this sengs SIGTERM, which programs may be programmed to handle,
        #so the progrma may still hang ( and in theory be trying to finish nicelly, although in practice this never happens... )

        #to kill it without mercy:

            killall -s 2

        #which sends SIGINT, which processes cannot handle, so they die

                exit

            #firefox still lives! it would be killed if it were not for nohup

        ##explanation

            #program ignores HUP (hangup) signal (signal is a linux os concept)

            #this signal is sent when the calling shell of a program is killed

            #most signals if uncaught (the case of most programs), kill the program

            #consequense: killing calling bash kills the program

            #*unless*, you use nohup

            #consequences of `nohup`:

            #- if stdin came from terminal (not pipe for example),
                #sdtin comes from `/dev/null` (you have no stdin!) instead

            #- if stdout would go to terminal (not pipe for example)
                #it is *appended to* `./nohup.out`, and if not possible from `$HOME/nohup.out`
                #instead
                #
                #if no stdout is generated, `nohup.out` is not created
                #
                #you can also redirect stdout to any file you want via `nohup cmd > file`
                #for example `nohup cmd > /dev/null` to ignore output
            #- the program is still visible in `jobs`, and may be killed with `kill %+`
            #- if you don't use `&`, it runs on foreground, preventing you from using bash

            #how to test all this:

                nohup bash -c 'for i in {1..10}; do echo $i; sleep 1; done'

            #try:

            #append `> f` to command
            #append `&`   to command

##puppet

    #Cross platform system configuration manager.

    #Allows to easily check and ensure presence of:

    #- files
    #- packages (software)
    #- user
    #- group
    #- cronjobs
    #- services

    #across multiple computers.

    #To do that, puppet creates an abstraction interface over all of those resources
    #that allows to represent them on multiple different platforms.

    #Next, each platform in which it is implemented must implement those resources,
    #by implementing for example methods to check and create those resources on the system.

    #For example, on all POSIX systems, puppet can implement user and group resources
    #via `useradd` programs, while a resource such as packages has to be implemented differently
    #on different Linux distros (apt-get on Ubuntu, yum on Fedora, etc.).

    #New resources can be installed via plugins, or made available in newer versions of puppet.

    #Good intro: <http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/index.html>

    ##describe subcommand

        #Get info on currently installed resources:

            puppet describe -l          # List all of the resource types available on the system.

            puppet describe user        # Print long information, similar to what appears in the type reference.

    ##resource subcommand

        #View or modify resources.

        #View all currently prsent user resources:

                    sudo echo a > b/a

                #The reason why this fails is that bash gives sudo two arguments: `echo` and `a`.

                #sudo does `echo a`, produces `a`, and then *bash* attempts the redirection by writing
                #`a` to `b/a`, which of course fails because bash does not the necessary permissions.

                #Workarounds for that include:

                #Put everything inside a single bash command:

                    sudo bash -c 'echo a > b/a'

                #This works, but may lead to quoting hell.

                    echo a | sudo tee b/a

                #And if we want to append to the file instead:

                    echo a | sudo tee -a b/a

                #The resaon this works is because `sudo` redirects its stdin
