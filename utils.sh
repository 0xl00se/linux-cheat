##about

  # This file is being cut up into smaller files.

  # Distribution specific installation procedures are put outside of this section.

  # For a summary of up to level 2 header: `grep -E '^[[:space:]]{0,4}##' %`.

##sources

  # - http://linux.die.net/

    # Linux man pages.

    # Also contains dive into python and advanced bash scripting,
    # so is a major site.

  # Almost official pages:

    # - http://www.kernel.org/

    # - http://git.kernel.org/

  # - http://www.tldp.org/

    # Many tutorials.

  # - the geek stuff

    # http://www.thegeekstuff.com

    # Short tutorials with lots of examples.

  # - tuxfiles

    # <http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html>

    # Some good tuts

  # - man pages

    # Not many examples, but full function list, and you often can guess what they mean!

  #- info pages

    # GNU project substitude for man.

    # Usually much longer explanations and examples.

    # Better nodewise navigation.

  # - Linux from scratch

    # Teaches how to build a minimal Linux distro

##man

  # The manuals.

  # POSIX 7 specifies only the option `-k` and nothing about pages,
  # those are Linux concepts.

  ##pages

    # The manual is organized into 7 pages.

    # When you install a new page, the developers decide where to put the documentation.

    # Every page has an intro section which says what it is about:

      man 2 intro
      man 3 intro

    # As in the case of the intro, you can distinguish ambiguities by giving the page number.

    # `write` system call:

      man 2 write

    # `write` shell command:

      man 1 write

    # List all entries of a page:

      man -k . | grep '(8)'

    # - 1: user commands (executables in path)

      # This is normally the largest section.

        man 1 passwd

    # - 2: system calls (c interface)

      # Those are *not* actual system calls, but portable low level system interfaces.

      # Most of the POSIX C library is here.

      #  POSIX write function:

        man 2 write

    # - 3: library. system call wrappers.

      # Higher level than 2.

      # Distinction from `man 2` is hard to tell.

      # Contains for example:

      # - some POSIX apis like pthreads
      # - X11 APIs

    # - 4: special files such as device files

        man 4 zero
        man 4 random
        man 4 mouse

    # - 5: file formats specifications.

      # Examples:

      # `/etc/passwd` file syntax:

        man 5 passwd

      # elf executable format:

        man 5 elf

    # - 6: games

    # - 7: standards.

      # Contains standards summaries such as:

        man unicode
        man url
        man X

    # - 8: system administration

      # Commands that mostly only root can do.

      # Their binaries are typically under `/usr/sbin/`.

      # Examples:

        man 8 adduser
        man 8 grub-install
        man 8 mount

  ##GNU command line options

    # Exact search on title. Shows only first page found match:

      man intro

    # shows each match in succession and asks if you want to continue on each quit:

      man -a intro

    # Search for commands with password word on summary:

      man -k password

    # Search on all of manual pages, may take some time:

      man -K password

    ##--regex

      # Whatever you were searching search with ERE now.

      # Regex on title:

        man --regex 'a.c'

      # Regex on entire manual:

        man --regex -K 'a.c'

      # Same

        apropos password

    # List all manual pages pages whose summaries match '.' regex: anychar)

      man -k .

    ##page

      # - <space>:  down one page. May change nodes.

      # - b, e: beginning/end of current node.
      # - s, /: search string
      # - {, }: repeat search back/forward

    ##menu

      # - <arrows>: move cursor
      # - <enter>: go to link under cursor
      # - <tab>: go to next link
      # - 1-9: go to menu item nb.
      # - m: select menu item in current page by name.
      #     can tab complete.
      #     even without tab complete, goes to first match on enter.

    ##node

      # - u: parent node
      # - t: top node
      # - [, ]: next previous node. May   change node level.
      # - n, p:             not
      # - l: go to last viewed node. can be used several times.
      # - g: like m, but search all nodes

    ##search

  ##echo

    #POSIX 7>

    ##versions

      #POSIX says that: A string to be written to standard output.

        #If the first operand is -n, or if any of the operands contain a <backslash> character,
        #the results are implementation-defined.

      #Which means that is your `echo` input statrs with `-n` or contains a backslash `\`,
      #behaviour is undetermined.

      #To make things worse, in practice different implementations *do* have different standards.

      #- On Ubuntu 13.04, `sh` has an `echo` built-in.

        #This version only accepts `-n` as a command line option,
        #and backslash escapes are always interpreted.

      #- `/bin/echo` by GNU. On Ubuntu 13.04, `bash` has no built-in called `echo`,
        #and therefore uses this one.

        #In this version, you need to use the `-e` option to activate the backslash escapes.

        #It seems that this is is slighltly *not* POSIX compliant since other options are introduced
        #such as `-e`, and POSIX seems to mandate that such strings be printed (`echo -e 'a' would print `-e a`)

      #The message then is clear: if you want to use escape chars, or ommit the ending newline,
      #do *not* use `echo`. Or even better, never use echo, only `printf`.

    #print to stdout:

      [ "`echo a`" = a ] || exit 1

    #multiple arguments are space separated:

      [ "`echo a b c`" = "a b c" ] || exit 1

    ##gnu implementation

      #As explained in the versions section, POSIX does not specificy behaviour
      #if `-n` input starts or if input contains `\n`, and in practice inplementations
      #recognze other command line options besides `-n`.

      #Appends newline at end by default.

      #-n: no final newline:

        echo -n a

      #Does not interpret `\` escaped chars by default:

        [ "`echo 'a\nb'`" = $'a\\nb' ] || exit 1

      #-e: interprets \ escaped chars:

        [ "`echo -e 'a\nb'`" = $'a\nb' ] || exit 1
        [ "`echo -e '\x61'`" = $'a' ] || exit 1

      #Print the `-n` string:
      #IMPOSSIBLE! not even gnu echo supports `--` since POSIX says that this should be supported.
      #=) use `printf`.

  ##printf

    # POSIX 7.

    # Goes around echo's quicks.

    # Anlogous to C printf.

    # Does not automatically append newline:

    # Automatically interprets backslash escapes like C printf:

      printf "a\nb"

    # Automatically interprets backslash escapes like C printf:

    # Print the `-n` string:

      [ "`printf "%s" "-n"`" == "-n" ] || exit 1

    # Supports C format strings:

      [ "`printf "%1.2d" 1`"    == "01" ] || exit 1
      [ "`printf "%1.2f" 1.23`"  == "1.23" ] || exit 1

    # Print the `-n` string:

      [ "`printf "%s" "-n"`" == "-n" ] || exit 1

    # Print a string ignoring all escape sequences (always appends terminates in a single newline):

      printf "%s\n" "\n\r"

    # Never terminate in a newline:

      printf "%s" "\n\r"

    # -u : uniq. remove dupesls -lh | sort -k5hr
    # -t: : set field separator to ':'
    # -k5 : sort by field N
      # -k 2,2n -k 4,4hr : sort by columns. from 2 to 2, numeric, then from 4 to 4, human and reverse
    # -R : randomize
    # -h : sort by human readable filesizes: 1k, 2M, 3G
    # -f : ignore case. random lower/upper order
    # -fs : ignore case and put always upper before lower
    # -b : ignore leading blanks
    # -uf : remove dupes, cas insensitive (A and a are dupes)
    # -m : supposesing f1 and f2 are already sorted, making merge faster
    # -c : check if is sorted

    ##GNU extensions

    # - 1: Minute (0-59)
    # - 2: Hours (0-23)
    # - 3: Day (0-31)
    # - 4: Month (0-12 [12 == December])

    #In both cases `ulimit` is implemented as a built-in.

    #View all limits (including the unit and the option name):

##read

  # Read from stdin and stores in shell variables.

  #Therefore, this *must* be a shell BUILTIN, since it modifies shell variables directly

  #POSIX 7.

  #Get string from user into variable `a`:

    #read a
    #echo "$a"

  #Cannot write with pipe into read because the pipe spawns a subshell,
  #which cannot modify a variable in its parent shell:
  #<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13763942/bash-why-piping-input-to-read-only-works-when-fed-into-while-read-const>

    a=a
    echo b | read a     #`read a` is executed in a subshell!
    [ $a = a ] || exit 1

  #Creating a subshell does work however:

    echo abc | ( read b; [ $b = abc ] || exit 1 ) || echo fail

  #and so do while combos, which also create one subshell per loop body:

    while read l; do
      echo "$l"
    done < <( echo -e "a\nb\na b" )

  #Read from file descriptor linewise and assign to variable.

  ##ps

    # POSIX 7

    # List current executing processes and their info.

    # On Ubuntu 12.04, implemented by the procps package.

    # `ps` is a tool with a complicated past and mulitple implementations.

    # The procps version http://procps.sourceforge.net/ supports multiple syntaxes for backwards compatibility:

    # - UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
    # - BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
    # - GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

    # For your sanity, we recommend that you use POSIX and GNU syntax only wherever possible,
    # never BSD syntax.


    # Implementations commonly use the proc filesystem.
    # There does not seem to be a POSIX way to implement this,
    # except maybe following a process tree.

    # Good short summary:

      ps --help

    # ps interface is ugly: some options have dash GNU style, others simply don't, and have no dash equivalent.
    # Live with it.

    # Best command to see all processes on the system:

      ps -eF

    # Output fields include:

    # - pid: unique identifier for all process on system
    # - tty: from which tty it was launched
    # - time: CPU time used for process, not real time
    # - cmd: command that launched th process without command line args
    # - rss: Resident Set Size: used memory.

    # See processes running on current tty:

      sleep 10 &
      sleep 10 &
      ps

    # Show all processes:

      ps -e

      # Show all columns (Full listing):

      ps -eF

    # Shows threads of each process:

      ps -em

    # Sort output by:

    # - cmd
    # - time reversed (because of the `-`)
    # - pid
    # - tty reversed (-)

      ps -ef --sort cmd,-time,pid,-tty

    # Get pid of parent of process with pid p

      p=
      ps -p $p -o ppid=

    ##GNU extensions

      # Show process tree:

        ps -A --forest

      # Sample output:

  ##pstree

    # psmisc package, not POSIX

    # Shows tree of which process invocates which

      pstree

    # This works because in POSIX new processes are created exclusively
    # by forking from other processes, and parent information is stored
    # on each process, which dies if the parent dies

    # this is a very insightfull program to understand what happened after
    # the `init` process, first process on the system and common ancestor of all, started

    # Particularaly interesting if you are on a graphical interface,
    # to understand where each process comes from

    # Quotint `man pstree`, multiple processes with same name and parent are wrttin in short notation:

      #init-+-getty
      #   |-getty
      #   |-getty
      #   `-getty

    # Becomes:

      #init---4*[getty]

    # Threads (run parallel, but on same data, and cannot fork) are indicated by brackets:

      #icecast2---13*[{icecast2}]

    # Means that `icecast2` has 13 threads.

  ##jobs

    # Shows:

    # - jobspec   : a local job id.
    # - status    : runnning, stopped, done
    # - invocation  : exact program call, including command line args. Ex: `ls ~`

      jobs

    # Show pids of background jobs:

      jobs -p

    ##jobspecs

      # Local job id, found by using <#jobs>

      # Certain commands such as `kill`, `fg` them in addition to pids.

      # They are:

      # - %N	Job number [N]
      # - %S	Invocation (command line) of job begins with string S
      #  If several matches, ambiguous, and does nothing.
      # - ?S	Invocation (command line) of job contains within it string S
      # - %%	"current" job (last job stopped in foreground or started in background)
      # - %+	"current" job (last job stopped in foreground or started in background)
      # - %-	last job

    # It is possible to use jobspecs directly with certain bash built-ins that could also take PID.
    # For example, to kill process by jobspec `%1`:

      #kill %1

    # Note that `kill` also usually exists as an external executable, and that the external executable
    # cannot kill by jobspec since this information is only known by bash itself.

    # `help kill` states that one of the reasons why `kill` is implemented as a bash built-in is to be
    # able to write `kill %1`.

    #ls &
    #sleep 100 &
    #sleep 100 &
    #sleep 100 &
      #runs on background
      #
      #[1] 12345678
      #means local id 1
      #process number 12345678
      #
      #when process ends, it prints ``[n] 1234`` and disappears
      #
      #stdout continues to go to cur terminal, even if in bg

  ##bg

    #POSIX 7

      #bg %3
        #starts running job 3 which was stopped on background
      #bg
      #bg %+
      #bg %%
        #last bg job [+]
      #bg %-
        #before last bg job [-]

  ##fg

    #POSIX 7

      #fg %3
        #starts running job 3 which was on background on foreground
      #fg
        #last job

  ##disown

    #vlc 100 &
    #vlc 100 &
    #vlc 100 &
    #disown %3
      #remove job 3 from list of sub jobs
      #closing bash will not kill it anymore

  ##kill

    # POSIX 7

    # Kill exists as a bash built-in.
    # One of the reasons for this is to allow users to `kill` by jobspec for example as `sleep 1- &; kill %1`,
    # Which an external executable could not do. Killin gby PID is required by POSIX 7.

    # Send signals to a process. Signals are an ANSI C concept, with POSIX and Linux extensions.

    # Does not necessarily send SIGKILL, nor is SIGKILL the default signal sent!
    # The default signal it sends is SIGTERM.

    # It is unfortunatelly named kill because most signals end up killing process,
    # or also because the most used signal is SIGTERM generated by a C-C on the terminal.
    # which has the usual effect of killing a process.

    # List all signals available on the system:

      kill -l

    # Lists numbers and descriptions.

    # Send SIGTERM signal to process:

      ps -A
      ID=
      kill $ID

    # SIGTERM is the default signal sent by `kill`.

    # Select by pid, found on ps for example.

    # Select by job-id found on jobs:

      sleep 10 &
      jobs
      kill %1

    # POSIX specifies this.

    # Send stop signal to process:

      kill -s SIGSTOP $ID
      kill -s sigstop $ID
      kill -s STOP $ID
      kill -s stop $ID

    # All of the above are specified by POSIX.

    # Where `SIGSTOP` is the standard signal name.

    # Also possible with the XSI extension:

      kill -SIGSTOP $ID
      kill -sigstop $ID
      kill -STOP $ID
      kill -stop $ID

    # But not recommended because it is less uniform parameter passing,
    # and not guaranteed to be on all implementations.

  ##killall

    # Send signals to all process by name

    # psmisc package

    # Application: firefox/skype hanged. `ps -A | grep -i firef',
    # confirm that the name is firefox and that it is the only one with that name, and then:

      killall firefox

    # This sengs SIGTERM, which programs may be programmed to handle,
    # so the progrma may still hang ( and in theory be trying to finish nicelly, although in practice this never happens... )

    # Kill it without mercy:

      killall -s 2

    # which sends SIGINT, which processes cannot handle, so they die.

  ##env

    # POSIX 7

    # Shows all environment variables and their values:

      env

    # Change environment for a single command:

      a=b
      env a=c echo $a
      #c
      echo $a
      #b

    # In bash it is also possible to do (not sure about portability):

      a=b
      a=c echo $a
      #c
      echo $a
      #b

    ##-i

      #exec in a clean environment:

        [ "`env -i a=b env`" = "a=b" ] || exit 1

      ##start a subshell in the cleanest env possible

        #don't forget: subshells inherit all exported vars

          env -i bash --noprofile --norc
          env
          #some default vars might still be there!
          #I get: SHLVL, PWD
          exit

  ##nohup

    # POSIX 7

    # Make a process that continues to run even if calling bash dies:

      nohup firefox >/dev/null &
      echo "$!" > /tmp/firefox-pid
      exit

    # This would send a HUP signal to Firefox, which kills most programs.

    # Firefox still lives! it would be killed if it were not for nohup.

    # When you do this, you will often want to store the PID of the program to kill it later with:

      kill "$(cat firefox-pid)"

    # Consequences of `nohup`:

    # - if stdin came from terminal (not pipe for example),
    #     sdtin comes from `/dev/null` (you have no stdin!) instead
    #
    # - if stdout would go to terminal (not pipe for example)
    #     it is *appended to* `./nohup.out`, and if not possible from `$HOME/nohup.out`
    #     instead
    #
    #     If no stdout is generated, `nohup.out` is not created
    #
    #     you can also redirect stdout to any file you want via `nohup cmd > file`
    #     for example `nohup cmd > /dev/null` to ignore output
    # - the program is still visible in `jobs`, and may be killed with `kill %+`
    # - if you don't use `&`, it runs on foreground, preventing you from using bash

    # How to test all this:

      nohup bash -c 'for i in {1..10}; do echo $i; sleep 1; done'

    # Try:

      #append `> f` to command
      #append `&`  to command

      jobs
      cat nohup.out

  ##timeout

    # Run command for at most n seconds, and kill it if it does not finish in time

    # coreutils

      [ `timeout 3 bash -c 'for i in {1..2}; do echo $i; sleep 1; done'` = $'1\n2\n' ] || exit 1
      [ `timeout 1 bash -c 'for i in {1..2}; do echo $i; sleep 1; done'` = $'1\n' ] || exit 1

  ##nice

    # - -20: highest priority
    # - 20: lowest priority

    # Mnemonic: the nicest you are, the more you let others run!

    # POSIX 7

    # Therefore the concept of niceness is included in POSIX.

    # View nice of all processes:

      ps axl

    # Run program with a nice of 10:

      nice -10 ./cmd

    #- 10:

  ##chroot

    # Execute single command with new root.

    # The root of a process is a Linux concept: every process descriptor has a root field,

    ##application

      # You have a partition that contains a linux system,
      # but for some reason you are unable to run it.

      # You can use that partition with bash by using chroot into it,
      # and you might then try to fix it from there.

      # Example:

        sudo chroot /media/other_linux/

      # More advanced example, if you want to start from a completelly clean bash environment:

        sudo chroot /media/other_linux /bin/env -i \

  ##rsync

    # Very powerful and flexible file copy tool.

    # Can:
    # - works over networks. Both machines must have it installed.
    #
    #     Capable of compressing before sending over the network, and decrompressing on the other side.
    #
    # - synchronize differentially
    # - encrypt files sent

    # Useful options:

    # - `-a`: "archive mode".

      # Sets : `-Dgloprt`

      # Does what you want it to do, even before you know you need it:

      # - `-D`: preserve special and device files. Requires sudo.
      # - `-g`: preserve group. Requires `sudo`.
      # - `-l`: copy symlinks as symlinks.
      # - `-o`: perserve owner. Requires `sudo`.
      # - `-p`: preserve permissions.
      # - `-r`: recurse into directories.
      # - `-t`: preserve modification times.

    # - `--exclude=`: Exclude directories.
    # - `-v`: verbose
    # - `-z`: compress files before transfer, decompress after.

      # Useful if transfer will be done over a network,
      # so that smaller files can be transferred.

    # Combos:

      # Back up everything except `/media` (where the backup will go to), and `/home`.

        #sudo rsync -av --exclude=home --exclude=media / /media/SOMETHING/bak

      # WARNING: your disk must be ext4, not NTFS, or permissions are impossible.

  ##rm

    # Remove files and dirs.

    # -r: recursive. Mandatory for directories. Potentially dangerous.

  ##recover data removed with rm like tools

    # `rm` only removes files from filesystem indexes, but the data remains in place
    # until the event that another file is writen on it, which may take severl minutes or hours.

    # Even after the file data overwritten few times, it is still possible to recover
    # the data using expensive forensic methods (only viable for organizations).

    # To permanently remove data from hard disk, you must use a tool like shred,
    # which writes certain sequences to the hard disk, making it impossible to
    # recover the data even with forensic methods.

    # Such operations take a very long time, and are not viable on entire hard disks,
    # so if you serious about clearing a hard disk, mechanical desctruction is a better option
    # (open the hard disk case and destroy the disk).

  ##rename

    # Mass file regex renaming.

    # Dry run:

      rename -n 's/^([0-9]) /0$1 /g' *.mp3

  ##mkfifo

    # POSIX 7

    # Make a fifo (named pipe).

    # Example:

      mkfifo f
      echo a > f &

    # `echo` writes to the pipe with a write system call.

    # The pipe has not been opened to read
    # therefore the echo write system call blocks.

      cat f

    # Outputs `a`. Both `echo` and `cat` finish.

    # - `cat` reads the pipe to read
    # - `echo` puts its data on the pipe
    # - `echo` terminates
    # - `cat` reads the data from the pipe and terminates

  ##mknod

    # Create character, block or FIFO (named pipe) files.

  ##locate

    # Searchs for files in entire computer.

    # Prints all matches.

    # This uses a database, which must be updated with updatedb before your new file is found.

    # Commonly, `updatedb` is a cronjob.

    # Match any substring in entire path:

      locate a
      locate /a

    # To force update of file cache, use updatedb.

  ##updatedb

    # Update file cache for locate:

      sudo updatedb

  ##file

    # POSIX 7

    # Attempts to determine file type and retreive metadata.

    # This is in general impossible,
    # but program makes good guesses.

      echo a > a
      file a

    # Output:

      a: ASCII text

    ##-L

  ##fuser

    #psmisc package

    # Determines which process are using a file or directory.

    # Can send signals to those processes.

      fuser .

    # Shows pids followed by a suffix:

    # -`c`: current directory
    # -`e`: executable being run
    # -`f`: open file. f is omitted in default display mode
    # -`F`: open file for writing. F is omitted in default display mode
    # -`r`: root directory
    # -`m`: mmap’ed file or shared library

    # You will have at least one process here: your bash

    # Also Show program and user:

      fuser -v .

    # Check process using tcp/udp ports:

      fuser -v -n tcp 5000

  ##mktemp

    # Create temporary files in the temporary directory.

    # Creates a temporary file in `/tmp/`:

      f="$(mktemp)"
      echo "$f"
      assert test -f "$f"
      rm "$f"

    # Directory:

      d="$(mktemp -d)"

  ##pathchk

    # Check if path is portable across POSIX systems:

      pathchk -p 'a'
      pathchk -p '\'

  ##fdupes

    # Fine command line tool for eliminating byte by byte duplicates
    # you can either:

    # - pick one by one
    # - tell fdupes to pick the first one without asking (seem to pick one of the dirs first always)

    # Finds and prints dupes:

      fdupes -r .

    # Finds dupes, and prompt which to keep for each match

      fdupes -rd .

##setterm

  # Outputs stdout that changes terminal properties.

  # Turns the cursor on/off:

    setterm -cursor off
    setterm -cursor on

##users and groups

  # To play around with those in Ubuntu, do ctrl+alt+f2, f3 ... f7
  # and you will go into login shells
  # so you can log with different users at the same time.

  # List users:

    cat /etc/passwd | sort

  # Sample output:

    #ciro:x:1000:1000:ciro,,,:/home/ciro:/bin/bash

  # - `ciro`: user name
  # - `x`: password is encrypted and stored in /etc/shadow
  # - `1000`: user id. 0: root. 1-99: predefined. 100-999: reserved by system. 1000: first `normal` user
  # - `1000`: primary user group
  # - `ciro,,,` : comment field. Used by finger command.
  # - `/home/ciro`: home dir
  # - `/bin/bash`: login shell

  # You are likely to see many users beside those which have a home directory.

  # This is so because many applications create their own users.

  # List groups:

    cat /etc/group

  # Format:

    #groupname:x:5:user1,user2,user3
    #x: encrypted pass if any
    #5: group id. `regular` groups start at 1000

  # Cat line of /etc/group for group g

    getent group "$g"

    cat /etc/default/useradd

  ##groups

    # List groups of user `"$u"`:

      groups "$u"

    # Sample output:

      username : group0 group1 group2

    # List groups of the current user:

      groups

  ##who

    # POSIX 7.

    # List who is logged on system.

      who

  ##id

    # POSIX 7.

    # Shows user and group ids and names.

    # Show all info for a given user:

      u=root
      id "$u"

    # For current user:

      id

    # Effective userid:

      id -u

    # Effective username:

      id -un

    # Real userid:

      id -ur

    # Same but for groups:

      id -g
      id -gn
      id -gr

  ##whoami

    # Print effective user name:

      whoami

    # Same as `id -un`, but not POSIX, so never rely on it.

  ##last

    # List last user logins on system:

      last

  ##tty

    # Show current tty:

      tty

    # Sample output:

      #/dev/pts/1

  ##getty

    # The tty that runs on those ctrl-alt-F\d things:

      cat /etc/default/console-setup

    # Allow you to change the number of consoles and their locations:

      ACTIVE_CONSOLES="/dev/tty[1-6]"

  ##su

    # Become another user, such as root:

      su otheruser
        #enter otheruser pass
      whoami
        #otheruser

    # Start a login shell as user a:

      su - a

    # Without this starts a non-login shell.

    ##don't use from script

      # You probably don't want to use this on a script, only on interactive sessions.

      # Doing:

        printf 'echo a\nsu a\necho b' | bash -x

      # Gives:

        su: must be run from a terminal

      # Doing:

        echo 'echo a
        su git
        echo b
        ' > a.sh
        bash a.sh -x

      # Stops the script and puts you on an interactive session.

      # Workarounds for scripts: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1988249/how-do-i-use-su-to-execute-the-rest-of-the-bash-script-as-that-user>

      # TODO understand behaviour precisely.

    ##become root

      #BAD: never become root, as it is dangerous.

      #Give root a pass so people can log into it:

        sudo passwd root

      #On some systems such as ubuntu, sudo has no pass by default.

        su
          #enter root pass
        whoami
          #root

    ##login

      #TODO0 login vs su?

  ##sudo ##sudoers

    # Do next single command as another user or super user.

    # Safer than becoming root with su.

    # Configuration file:

      sudo cat /etc/sudoers

    ##visudo

     # Should only be edited with visudo, analogous to vipw.

       sudo visudo

    # Syntax:

      # After any user enters a pass, he can sudo without pass for 15 mins:

        #Defaults:ALL timestamp_timeout=15

      # Turn it off. Better for safety.

        #Defaults:ALL timestamp_timeout=0

      #main lines:
        #user  hostip=(runas)NOPASSWD ALL
        #%group hostip=(runas)    :/bin/ls,/bin/cat
          #user: who will get sudo premissions

    # CLI:

      #sudo sh -c "echo '$(id -un) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' >> /etc/sudoers"

    ##redirection

      # sudo passes its stdin to the called program:

        echo a | sudo cat
          #a

      # Cannot "echo to a file" directly without permission

        su a
        mkdir b
        chown b b
        #fails:
        sudo echo a > b/a

      # The reason why this fails is that bash gives sudo two arguments: `echo` and `a`.

      # sudo does `echo a`, produces `a`, and then *bash* attempts the redirection by writing
      # `a` to `b/a`, which of course fails because bash does not the necessary permissions.

      # Workarounds for that include:

      # Put everything inside a single bash command:

        sudo bash -c 'echo a > b/a'

      # This works, but may lead to quoting hell.

      # sudo a tee and let it do the work:

        echo a | sudo tee b/a

      # And if we want to append to the file instead:

        echo a | sudo tee -a b/a

      # The resaon this works is because `sudo` redirects its stdin
      # to the stdin of the program it will call.

      # `-e` to edit a file as sudo:

        sudo -e /etc/file.conf

      # Multiline sudo via EOF:

        sudo tee /some/path <<EOF
EOF

    ##ubuntu default sudo config

      # In Ubuntu, sudo group allows members to sudo whatever they want as root

  ##useradd

    # Create a new user with username `$u`:

      u=
      sudo useradd -ms /bin/bash $u
      sudo passwd "$u"

    # For users that represent human end users, you will amost always want to use the following:

    # - `-m` make home dir owned the user him with permissions 707.

      # Without `-m` it is possible that X11 won't work.

      # A tty login starts at `/`.

      # Initial home dir files will me copied from a default template located at `/etc/skel`

      # To change this template use: `-k /path/to/skel/`.

      # Ro create no files: `-k /dev/null`

      # If you forgot to use `-m` when you created the user this can be corrected by doing:

        sudo mkdir /home/$u
        sudo chmod 700 /home/$u $u
        sudo chown /home/$u $u

    # - `-p pass`

      # Set password for the user.

      # It is possible to create an user without a password,
      # but then he won't be able to login.

      # This has the disadvantage that the password will be visible.

      # To create a password without showing it on screen,
      # consider using the `passwd` command.

    # - `-s` sets login shell

      # You should probably set this to `/bin/bash`.

      # If you forgot this, consider using chsh.

    # - `-g 1001`: set group the user belongs to

      # If g missing, either create a group u and add user
      # to a default group specified in some config file

    # - `-G 1002, 1003`: set secondary groups

    # - `-c '$fullname,$office,$office2,$homephone'`

      # Comment field thatwill end up on `/etc/passwd`.

      # Any string is possiblt, but this particular format is recognized by the `finger` command
      # and should always be used.

      # To change this afterwards consier the `chfn` command.

    # - `e`: password expires automatically at the given date.

    # - `f`: account disables 5 days after password expires if pass not changed.

  ##userdel

    # Remove users.

       usermod -aG $g $u

    # Change home dir of user u to d.
    # The old contents are not moved:

       usermod -d $d $u

    # Also move his current dir contents to new dir:

  ##passwd

    # File that holds usernames and key account options,
    # and command line utility to edit that file.

    # Actual passwords are normally stored hashed in the `/etc/shadow` file.

    # Modify passwd for cur user:

      passwd

    # Modify passwd for user u:

      sudo passwd "$u"

    # If you are not u, you need sudo.

    # Delete passwd for u, disabling login on his account:

      sudo passwd -d "$u"

    # Delete passwd for u, disabling login on his account
    # until a new passwd is created.

    # Lock account of user:

      sudo passwd -l "$u"

    # He cannot login anymore.
    # `sudo su` and ssh public key based logins still work since they don't use the user's password.
    # `sudo -u $u` also works.

    # On the `/etc/shadow` file, an exclamation mark was added
    # before hash of the password:
