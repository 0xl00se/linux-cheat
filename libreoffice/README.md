## Calc

Table /spreadsheet editor like Excel.

To try it out, use the `.csv` files in this directory.

## Configuration

Always show a row or column on stick rows. Useful for the header if the table is long and if there is only a single table in the spreadsheet.

- click on column that *follows* the one that should always show
- Window > Freeze

## Pivot table

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r7z8YSXG18>

Was called "Data Pilot", but finally gave in to the Microsoft terminology.

Is basically a UI for SQL `GROUP BY` queries.

Create: Select the table > Data > Pivot table. Drag and drop header fields into row, column and data.

Dragging multiple headers on rows or columns creates a hierarchy. It is not possible to open or close hierarchies quickly on the table directly: you must right click and edit the pivot layout.

To drilldown the facts, double click on the data cell. This opens a new tab with the drilldown table.
