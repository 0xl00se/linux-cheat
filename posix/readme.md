Cheat on POSIX, including the POSIX C API.

POSIX command line utilities shall not be discussed here.
This decision has been made because it is better to group utilities together with other
non-POSIX utilities which have similar functions, for exapmle discussing both `kill` (POSIX)
and `killall` (non-POSIX) side by side.
