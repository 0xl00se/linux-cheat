main cheat on posix c headers

#defines

    these are headers specified by posix

    on current ubuntu system this is implemented by the gnu c library:
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/> says that POSIX compliance
    is a design goal of the gnu c library

    list of all headers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_POSIX_library

    posix defines certain things **INSIDE**
    headers with the same name as the ansi stdlib ones
    which are only activated if you add the defines **before
    including those files**!!

    gcc: if you want to access them with the `-ansi -c99` flags,
    you need to define `XXX_XOPEN_SOURCE`

    TODO is there a windows implementation for those headers?

    there are other headers which may expose posix functions such as `_POSIX_C_SOURCE` and `POSIX_SOURCE`
    for `gcc`, see `man feature_test_macros` for an explanaition.

    the value refers to the actual posix version

    for example:

    - 500: issue 5, 1995
    - 600: issue 6, 2004
    - 700: issue 7, 2008

    #open

        open file descriptors such as files

        returns an `int` (file descriptor number) instead of a file

        flags. Must specify one and only of the following:

        - O_WRONLY: write only
        - O_RDONLY: read only
        - O_RW: read only

        the following may all be specified:

        - O_APPEND: Place written data at the end of the file.
        - O_TRUNC: Set the length of the file to zero, discarding existing contents.
        - O_CREAT: Creates the file, if necessary, with permissions given in mode.
        - O_EXCL: Used with O_CREAT, ensures that the caller creates the file. The open is atomic; that is,
            itâ€™s performed with just one function call. This protects against two programs creating the file at
            the same time. If the file already exists, open will fail.

        return value: `-1` on error.

        you can also use standard flags for permissions:

        - S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
        - S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
        - S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner

        GRP for group versions
        OTH for other versions

    #write

        write to file descriptor, such as one gotten with `open`

        returns number of bytes written

        it writes as many bytes as possible

        if it receives a signal before writting, returns -1

    #read

        returns number of bytes read

        0 if at end of file descriptor already

        -1 if error

            - off_t st_size           For regular files, the file size in bytes.

                                      For symbolic links, the length in bytes of the
                                      pathname contained in the symbolic link.

                                      For a typed memory object, the length in bytes.

                                      For other file types, the use of this field is
                                      unspecified.

            - struct timespec st_atim Last data access timestamp.
            - struct timespec st_mtim Last data modification timestamp.
            - struct timespec st_ctim Last file status change timestamp.

            - blksize_t st_blksize    A file system-specific preferred I/O block size
                                      for this object. In some file system types, this
                                      may vary from file to file.
            - blkcnt_t st_blocks      Number of blocks allocated for this object.

        #find if a file exists

            in *nix, you often cannot be sure if a file or directory exists,
            because to do that you must have permission to list all of its parent dirs.

            the only thing you can say is that a path is accessible or not.

            using stat is a good way to do that.
