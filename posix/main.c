main cheat on posix c headers

#defines

    these are headers specified by posix

    on current ubuntu system this is implemented by the gnu c library:
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/> says that POSIX compliance
    is a design goal of the gnu c library

    list of all headers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_POSIX_library

    posix defines certain things **INSIDE**
    headers with the same name as the ansi stdlib ones
    which are only activated if you add the defines **before
    including those files**!!

    gcc: if you want to access them with the `-ansi -c99` flags,
    you need to define `XXX_XOPEN_SOURCE`

    TODO is there a windows implementation for those headers?

    there are other headers which may expose posix functions such as `_POSIX_C_SOURCE` and `POSIX_SOURCE`
    for `gcc`, see `man feature_test_macros` for an explanaition.

    the value refers to the actual posix version

    for example:

    - 500: issue 5, 1995
    - 600: issue 6, 2004
    - 700: issue 7, 2008

    #open

        open file descriptors such as files

        returns an `int` (file descriptor number) instead of a file

        flags. Must specify one and only of the following:

        - O_WRONLY: write only
        - O_RDONLY: read only
        - O_RW: read only

        the following may all be specified:

        - O_APPEND: Place written data at the end of the file.
        - O_TRUNC: Set the length of the file to zero, discarding existing contents.
        - O_CREAT: Creates the file, if necessary, with permissions given in mode.
        - O_EXCL: Used with O_CREAT, ensures that the caller creates the file. The open is atomic; that is,
            itâ€™s performed with just one function call. This protects against two programs creating the file at
            the same time. If the file already exists, open will fail.

        return value: `-1` on error.

        you can also use standard flags for permissions:

        - S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
        - S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
        - S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner

        OTH for other versions

    #write

        write to file descriptor, such as one gotten with `open`

        if it receives a signal before writting, returns -1

    #read

        returns number of bytes read

        0 if at end of file descriptor already

                    unidirectional child ----> parent transfer

                    single process must start two children process: data source and the data consumer
                    and connect them

                    advantages over files:

                    - simple: no need to agree on a filename to communicate over
                    - fast: no need to modify the filesystem or worse: do disk io!
                    - secure: other process cannot se the data as they could in a file

                    data very limited per buffer! BUFSIZ ~= 1000-10000 today,
                    and the only guarantee is being at least 256 bytes wide.

                    i think it is not possible to know if a file pointer
                    is open for reading or writtin besides looking at how
                    it was created

                    workflow:

                    - child fills the buffer, then parent takes control
                    - child fills ...

                    implementation dependant

                    in practice you could read/write much more than that,
                    but BUFSIZ is a good value

                    - fast
                    - not larger than the maximum

                    so in practice you will should just use this value as a maximum.

                    if you try to read write more than the max,
                    it just flushes all when the buffer gets filled

                    the larger the buffer the faster the transfer

                    the only guarantee is BUFSIZ >= 256

                    if you want to be very portable, you must design systems
                    whose messages need no more than 256 bytes at a time

                    with such a system, you could just pass many 256 chunks at once
                    if your large buffer allows (of course, it is likelly that each of
                    those 256 chunks will conatain its own header information)

                #popen

                    consider using ansi c `system` instead of this.

                    opens a new process running the given command.

                    given string runs inside `sh` in a separated process and therefore it is:

                    - slow
                    - does magic stuff like pathname expansion (`*.txt`)
                    - harder to port to non posix systems if one day you decide to do that

                    it seems from the posix docs that the interpreter `sh` cannot be changed.

                    Unlike the ANSI C `system` function,
                    does not automatically wait for the command to return: see `pclose` for that.

                    For that reason, `popen` is slightly more general than `system`,
                    as you can do more work in the current program begore getting the shell output.

                    This is not however extremelly useful since you usually need the shell output
                    to continue working anyways.

                    The output of peopen is put on an unnamed pipe, which is accessible via
                    ANSI C FILE type returned by the function, instead of posix file descriptor (integers)

                    Therefore you must use ANSI C file io functions like `fopen` or `fclose` with it,
                    instead of the more low level POSIX `open` or `write` family.

                #pclose

                    waits for child generated process.

                    returns child exit status.

                    if child was already waited for, returns -1 to incate an error.

                    differences from popen:

                    - does not use a shell, avoiding many of its problems

                    - uses integer file descriptors instead of ANSI C FILE type
                        therefore you manipulate pipes with file descriptor functions
                        like `open` and `write` instead of ANSI C `fopen` family.

                        This potentially gives you more control over the operations.

                    it may however be a bit harder to setup
