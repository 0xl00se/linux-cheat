main cheat on the POSIX C API

#defines

    these are headers specified by posix

    on current ubuntu system this is implemented by the gnu c library:
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/> says that POSIX compliance
    is a design goal of the gnu c library

    list of all headers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_POSIX_library

    posix defines certain things **INSIDE**
    headers with the same name as the ansi stdlib ones
    which are only activated if you add the defines **before
    including those files**!!

    gcc: if you want to access them with the `-ansi -c99` flags,
    you need to define `XXX_XOPEN_SOURCE`

    TODO is there a windows implementation for those headers?

    there are other headers which may expose posix functions such as `_POSIX_C_SOURCE` and `POSIX_SOURCE`
    for `gcc`, see `man feature_test_macros` for an explanaition.

    the value refers to the actual posix version

    for example:

    - 500: issue 5, 1995
    - 600: issue 6, 2004
    - 700: issue 7, 2008

#TODO

    #ptrace

        one process (tracer) observes another process' (tracee) memory directly

    #erros

        typical error dealing conventions POSIX are:

        - if the return value is not needed, functions return 0 on successs and either -1 on failure
            or an integer which indicates failure cause
        - if the return value is strictly positive, return a negative value on error
        - if the return value is a pointer, return `NULL` on error

        whenever there is an error, set `errno` accordingly to determine what was the cause of the erro

    #errno.h

        is defined by ANSI, but more predefined error constants are added extended in POSIX,
        and each error has a standard associated error message TODO check

        including functions that deal with the error messages

        some of the POSIX only errors are: TODO check that those are not in ansi c

        - EPERM: Operation not permitted

            when users try to do something which requires previledges that they don't have,
            such as being the root user.

        - ENOENT: No such file or directory
        - EINTR: Interrupted system call
        - EIO: I/O Error
        - EBUSY: Device or resource busy
        - EEXIST: File exists
        - EINVAL: Invalid argument
        - EMFILE: Too many open files
        - ENODEV: No such device
        - EISDIR: Is a directory
        - ENOTDIR: Isn’t a directory

        those error descriptions are also programatically accessible through functions
        such as `perror` or `strerror`

        the following may all be specified:

        - O_APPEND: Place written data at the end of the file.
        - O_TRUNC: Set the length of the file to zero, discarding existing contents.
        - O_CREAT: Creates the file, if necessary, with permissions given in mode.
        - O_EXCL: Used with O_CREAT, ensures that the caller creates the file. The open is atomic; that is,
            it’s performed with just one function call. This protects against two programs creating the file at
            the same time. If the file already exists, open will fail.

            in practice you could read/write much more than that,

            - fast

            consider using ansi c `system` instead of this.

            opens a new process running the given command.

            given string runs inside `sh` in a separated process and therefore it is:

            - slow
            - does magic stuff like pathname expansion (`*.txt`)
            - harder to port to non posix systems if one day you decide to do that

            it seems from the posix docs that the interpreter `sh` cannot be changed.

            Unlike the ANSI C `system` function,
            does not automatically wait for the command to return: see `pclose` for that.

            For that reason, `popen` is slightly more general than `system`,
            as you can do more work in the current program begore getting the shell output.

            This is not however extremelly useful since you usually need the shell output
            to continue working anyways.

            The output of peopen is put on an unnamed pipe, which is accessible via
            ANSI C FILE type returned by the function, instead of posix file descriptor (integers)

            Therefore you must use ANSI C file io functions like `fopen` or `fclose` with it,
            instead of the more low level POSIX `open` or `write` family.

            create unnamed pipes

            very close to the linux pipe system call

            differences from popen:

            - does not use a shell, avoiding many of its problems

            - uses integer file descriptors instead of ANSI C FILE type
                therefore you manipulate pipes with file descriptor functions
                like `open` and `write` instead of ANSI C `fopen` family.

                This potentially gives you more control over the operations.

            it may however be a bit harder to setup
