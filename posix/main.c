main cheat on the POSIX C API

#defines

    these are headers specified by posix

    on current ubuntu system this is implemented by the gnu c library:
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/> says that POSIX compliance
    is a design goal of the gnu c library

    list of all headers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_POSIX_library

    posix defines certain things **INSIDE**
    headers with the same name as the ansi stdlib ones
    which are only activated if you add the defines **before
    including those files**!!

    gcc: if you want to access them with the `-ansi -c99` flags,
    you need to define `XXX_XOPEN_SOURCE`

    TODO is there a windows implementation for those headers?

    there are other headers which may expose posix functions such as `_POSIX_C_SOURCE` and `POSIX_SOURCE`
    for `gcc`, see `man feature_test_macros` for an explanaition.

    the value refers to the actual posix version

    for example:

    - 500: issue 5, 1995
    - 600: issue 6, 2004
    - 700: issue 7, 2008

#TODO

    #ptrace

        one process (tracer) observes another process' (tracee) memory directly

    #errors

        Typical error dealing conventions POSIX are:

        - if the return value is not needed, functions return 0 on successs and either -1 on failure
            or an integer which indicates failure cause

        - if the return value is strictly positive, return -1 on error

        - if the return value is a pointer, return `NULL` on error

        - if the return value can be any integer (`ptrace` for example), return `-1`, but force the user to
            clear `errno` before making the call, and check if `errno != -` after the call.

        Whenever there is an error, set `errno` accordingly to determine what was the cause of the erro

    #errno.h

        Is defined by ANSI, but more predefined error constants are added extended in POSIX,

        In POSIX, each error has a standard associated error message
        which can be retreived and printed with functions such as `perror`.

        Some of the POSIX specific errors and their error messages are: TODO check that those are not in ansi c

        - EPERM: Operation not permitted

            when users try to do something which requires previledges that they don't have,
            such as being the root user.

        - ENOENT: No such file or directory
        - EINTR: Interrupted system call
        - EIO: I/O Error
        - EBUSY: Device or resource busy
        - EEXIST: File exists
        - EINVAL: Invalid argument
        - EMFILE: Too many open files
        - ENODEV: No such device
        - EISDIR: Is a directory
        - ENOTDIR: Isnâ€™t a directory

        Functions that modify errno document that. The convention is that only functions which fail modify
        errno, not those that succeed.

        errno can be modified as `errno = 0` for example.

        - O_RW: read only

        the following may all be specified:

        - O_APPEND: Place written data at the end of the file.
        - O_TRUNC: Set the length of the file to zero, discarding existing contents.
        - O_CREAT: Creates the file, if necessary, with permissions given in mode.
        - O_EXCL: Used with O_CREAT, ensures that the caller creates the file. The open is atomic; that is,
            itâ€™s performed with just one function call. This protects against two programs creating the file at
            the same time. If the file already exists, open will fail.

        return value: `-1` on error.

        you can also use standard flags for permissions:

        - S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
        - S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
        - S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner

                would be annoying ( would require calling `pathconf` ).

            - `resolved_name == NULL`: the pathname is copied to `resolved_name`.

                This is a good option if you already have a large enough buffer laying around,
                since it does not require dynamic allocation.

        #find if a file exists

            in *nix, you often cannot be sure if a file or directory exists,
            because to do that you must have permission to list all of its parent dirs.

            the only thing you can say is that a path is accessible or not.

            using stat is a good way to do that.

            - real is always of who executes the program

        #getpriority

            Each process, user and group has a priority associated to it.

            Those priorities are commonly called *nice* values on UNIX, since 
            the higher the nice, the less time it takes ( it is nicer to other processes)

            POSIX does not fix the nice range, but it does specify that:

            - lower values are more favorable
            - the values must be between `-{NZERO}` and x{NZERO}-1`.

            where NZERO is a paremeter that can be reterived with TODO

            The minimum value for NZERO if 20, it is also the most common.

            The actual effect of priority is undefined.

            Nice:

                int nice( int incr )

            - incr: how much to increase the nice value
            - return: the new nice value after the increase

            getpriority:

                int getpriority(int which, id_t who);

            - which:

                - PRIO_PROCESS:
                - PRIO_PGRP: TODO
                - PRIO_USER: TODO

            - who: pid, uid or gid depending on which. `0` means current.

            #error checking

                On error, returns `-1` and errno set to indicate the error.

                Therefore simply checking the return value is not enough to detect an error
                since `-1` is a valid return value.

                Therefore, to do error checking one *must* check `errno != 0`:

                - set `errno = 0`
                - make the call
                - there is an error iff ret = -1 errno != 0.

        #setpriority

            Return value is the same as getpriority after the modification.

        #nice

            Same as setpriority, but only for `PRIO_PROCESS` but increments (or decrements) the value instead of setting it to an absolute value.

            Return value is the same as getpriority after the modification.

        #fork and buffering

            <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3513242/working-of-fork-in-linux-gcc>

            there are three buffering methods:

            - unbuffered
            - fully buffered
            - line buffered

            when you fork, the streams get forked too,
            with unflushed data still inside

            stdout and stderr flush at newlines
            if you don't put newlines, if does not flush,
            and fork copies the buffers


            this will print everything twice

    #vfork

        fork but keep same address space. POSIX 7 discourages its use,
        and says that it may be deprecated in the future

    #wait()

        wait for any child to terminate and then wake up

    #waitpid()

        wait for child with given PID to terminate

    #copy on write #COW

        often the fork is followed by an operation which does not use the old memory
        such as `exec`, making copying the data useless.

        some operating systems may at first not copy memory from old process,
        but wait util memory is written to do that.

        this has page granularity (physical RAM parameter, larger than most variables)

            consider using ansi c `system` instead of this.

            opens a new process running the given command.

            given string runs inside `sh` in a separated process and therefore it is:

            - slow
            - does magic stuff like pathname expansion (`*.txt`)
            - harder to port to non posix systems if one day you decide to do that

            it seems from the posix docs that the interpreter `sh` cannot be changed.

            Unlike the ANSI C `system` function,
            does not automatically wait for the command to return: see `pclose` for that.

            For that reason, `popen` is slightly more general than `system`,
            as you can do more work in the current program begore getting the shell output.

            This is not however extremelly useful since you usually need the shell output
            to continue working anyways.

            The output of peopen is put on an unnamed pipe, which is accessible via
            ANSI C FILE type returned by the function, instead of posix file descriptor (integers)

            Therefore you must use ANSI C file io functions like `fopen` or `fclose` with it,
            instead of the more low level POSIX `open` or `write` family.

            create unnamed pipes

            very close to the linux pipe system call

            differences from popen:

            - does not use a shell, avoiding many of its problems

            - uses integer file descriptors instead of ANSI C FILE type
                therefore you manipulate pipes with file descriptor functions
                like `open` and `write` instead of ANSI C `fopen` family.

                This potentially gives you more control over the operations.

            it may however be a bit harder to setup
