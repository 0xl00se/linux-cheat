gnu extensions to libc in its implementation called glibc

POSIX APIs shall not be discussed in general,
only points which arespecific to Linux shall be discussed

note that many constants are contained inside the POSIX headers,
typically at points where POSIX says that implementations
may implement their own extensions

latest versions of the docs: <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/>

it is *highly* recommended that you get a copy of those
and try to use it right away.
