gnu extensions to libc in its implementation called glibc

glibc is what implements and extends POSIX C APIs in just about every Linux distro.
POSIX C API shall not be discussed, only points which are specific to glibc shall be discussed

Latest versions of the docs: <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/>
It is *highly* recommended that you get a copy of those
and try to use it right away.
