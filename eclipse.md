# Eclipse

Programming IDE.

## Vs Vim

Advantages over Vim:

- everything coded in Java
- huge Java integration

Downside:

- whatever you want to do you must click 50 menu items and there is no way to automate it
- many windows are not buffers. In Vim, everything is a buffer, e.g., a file browser, so you can reuse all file editing shortcuts.
- obtrusive interface: not possible to remove the bottom bar, huge warning on left

## Install Eclipse

Install Eclipse as a regular user, not as root or via package managers like `apt-get` because:

- you will get a much more updated version
- apt-get install crashes on Ubuntu 12.04!
- you need to open Eclipse with sudo to install packages. This causes other problems of its own.

## Preferences

Preferences, settings are under Window > Preferences

Make package manager follow current editor file:

### Spell checking

To add a word to the dictionary, you must first create the user dictionary. To get started, touch a `dict` file on your workspace, the search for spelling under preferences, and point to it.

To add words to the dictionary, hit F2, then click on add word to dictionary.

### Line wrapping

<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2846002/does-eclipse-have-line-wrap>

Hard is possible, soft is notoriously not.

### Project preferences

On the package explorer, click on the project and hit `Alt + Enter` or go File > Properties.

From there you can do things like:

- set how the project is run (`F12`), e.g. passing command line arguments to the program or to the VM.

## Keyboard shortcuts

General > Keys

Navigate in editor and its tabs:

- 	`F3`: open definition in a new tab

- 	`Alt left`: go to the last location. May jump between lines and change tabs.

- 	`Ctrl + Shift + T`: find class definition (Type). Does a sort of Fuzzy search for capital letters.

- 	`Ctrl + Shift + R`: find files.

- 	`Ctrl + H`: search for Java things. Allows you to select classes, methods, fields, etc.

- 	`Alt + Shift + Q + XXX`: focus on many different things depending on `XXX`

    - `P`: Package Explorer

- 	`Alt + Shift + X + XXX`: run things

    - `J`: Java. Runs the `main` of the file.

- 	`Ctrl + T`: show a popup with type hierarchy of current class file. You can then click on the classes to jump to them.

- 	`Ctrl + Shift + Down/Up`: move to the next / previous class member

Navigate across editor and other widgets:

- 	`Ctrl + M`: Toggle maximize current window.

- 	`F12`: focus editor

Edit:

- 	`Ctrl + /`: toggle single line comment

- 	`Ctrl + Alt + J`: toggle single line comment

Misc:

- 	`F12`: run program. How it gets run is defined under the project properties.

## Non-keyboard stuff

- 	Jump to overridden method: a little triangle appears to the left of the method.

## Plugins

### Install

Install and search plugins through the Eclipse Marketplace.

From the IDE: Help > Eclipse Marketplace ... note the very intuitive placement under Help.

The website: <http://marketplace.eclipse.org/>

### Good plugins

Add Vim like editing to eclipse: <http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/update-site/stable>.

C and C++: <http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/indigo/>

Python: <http://pydev.org/updates>

HTML, JavaScript, PHP: <http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/repository/indigo/>

#### LaTeX

<http://texlipse.sourceforge.net>

Forward search to Okular:

Inverse search from Okular: Settings > Configure Okular > Editor

    Editor: custom text editor,
    Command: gvim --remote +%l %f

#### EGit

Configure: Preferences > Team

Parses git configure files as key value pairs and shows them on Eclipse. Doesn't even suggest possible key values.

#### Vrapper

<http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/home>

### StartExplorer

<https://github.com/basti1302/startexplorer>

Open file explorer or shell on given folder from Package Explorer.

Custom commands: go to Preferences > StartExplorer > Custom Commands.

You can use variables as described at: <http://basti1302.github.io/startexplorer/help/05_custom_commands.html>

E.g., start Guake here:

	guake -n "${resource_loc}"

No bindings for custom commands yet: <https://github.com/basti1302/startexplorer/issues/5>

### MoreUnit

Jump between a class and it's test file:
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1399491/eclipse-function-plugin-that-finds-corresponding-junit-class>

TODO how to use this? Clicking `Ctrl + J` tries to create a new test class instead of jumping to the existing one!

### Color themes

#### Editor color theme

Best place to find color themes: <http://eclipse-color-theme.github.com/update>. It already comes with many color themes.

The best way is to install the Eclipse Color Theme plug-in and install new plugins with General > Appearance > Color Theme

Otherwise to install `.epf` themes: File > Import > Preferences > Select *.epf

Vibrant Ink is a good choice as usual.

#### GUI color theme

For the rest of the GUI besides the editor, see Preferences > Appearance. `Dark` is the only one my eyes will accept, but id does break some functionality.
