cheatsheet on pandoc's markdown

#sources

great documentation page:

``` {.bash}
    man pandoc_markdown
```

if its clear there, it might not be here!

#header 1

##header 2

###header 3

#paragraph

paragraph 1

paragraph 2

##toc

to get a table linked of contents, use the `--toc` option
this gives ids based on name to the headers (strips illegal chars,
transforms spaces into hyphens)

##attributes {#attr .class1 .class2}

you can give explicit attributes to headers like this one

explicit ids will override automatic ids that would be generted by ``toc``

only the id has effect in latex (becomes a label), other don't even show in html for me...

according to docs it should also be possible to add arbitrary attributes of type a=b,
byt this breaks the header for me...

#list

A list:

- ul 1
- ul 2

Must have blank line after last paragraph:
- this is not an item
- neither is this

#####no need for a blank line after last header
- ul 1
- ul 2

but don't do this, it confusing and hard to read.

##ordered

#. a
#. a

1) a
2) a
3) a

(1) a
(2) a
(3) a

1. a
2. a
3. a

<!-- -->

2. a
1. a
3. a

##example list

###no tag

(@) no tag. a bit useless.

a paragraph

(@) no tag. a bit useless.

must be at start of line to work: (@)

###tagged
###tagged

(@tag1) text of tag1

ref to tag1: (@tag1)

(@tag2) text of tag2

ref to tag1: (@tag1)

(@tag1) <-- cannot start line directly with reference. It will be treated as a list item.

#links

Basic: [text](destination)

Automatic: <link>. You *must* use the angular brackets
even if some versions of markdown allow you to ommit them such as github's.

Inner id: [text](#links). Also works in latex!

##label

Label definitions can go anywhere and it won't show:

[label-name]: label-dest

However it is good practice to put them all at the end.

use **square** brackets instead of parenthesis: [text][label-name]

also works implicitly: [label-name][]

you can also link to: [header links generated by ``toc``][label]

but not if you gave an explicit label to it: [broken][label2], [broken][label3]

###label2 {#label3}

##relative link between different files

possible:

[readme.html](readme.html)

[readme.pdf](readme.pdf)

[readme](readme)

the problem is that you have to give the output extension here (html/pdf)
and AFAIK there is no cross ouptut way to do do this.

TODO new feature

#code block

Inline: `*this is inline code*`

Inline backtick: `` ` ``

Inline double backtick: ``` `` ```

Inline with attributes: `a = 1 if True else 2`{#inline-with-attrs .python a="b"}

Indented:

    this is a block
    it can contain many lines

Must have blank line after last paragraph:
    this is not a block
    because it does not have a blank line before last paragraph

Can have a paragraph afterwards without blank line:

    code block
paragraph after code block without blank line. Don't do this tough: it confusing and hard to read.

Delimited code block with tildes:

~~~
import os

def f(a):
    print a

f("abc")
~~~

with backticks:

```
import os

def f(a):
    print a

f("abc")
```

I prefer backticks for analogy with inline blocks. It is less readable tough.

Give attributes:

```{#id .python .numberLines startFrom="100"}
import os

def f(a):
    print a

f("abc")
```

Language shortcut:

~~~python
import os

def f(a):
    print a

f("abc")
~~~

#math

Inline: $x^2$

Display on a single line:

$$x^2$$

Firs chars after first dollar and before lats one must not be space: $ x^2$ $x^2 $ $ x^2 $

Multiline and align:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a + b & = c     \\
    d & = e + f \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Must use double dollars `$$`!

#latex

Plain latex is ignored on html output:

\begin{equation}
    x^2
\end{equation}

Application: remove page number from a single page document: add the following line to the top:

    % A pdf file without page numbers created from pandoc markdown
    % sieste
    % June 2013

    \pagenumbering{gobble}

    # First header
    etc

It will not appear on html output.

#html

only works for html output, not for pdf, so never use it unless you really need it and can break pdf.

<p>par</p>

<p>par</p>

<ul>
    <li>item</li>
</ul>

#escaping stuff

\#

\*a*

\[a](b)

\`a`

\```

\```

##inner content is md parsed:

<p>**par**</p>

##comments

there is no real good way AFAIK

a good possibility is:

<!-- comment -->
