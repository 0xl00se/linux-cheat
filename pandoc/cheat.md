# header 1

## header 2

### header 3

# paragraph

paragraph 1

paragraph 2

# list

A list:

- ul 1
- ul 2

Must have blank line after last paragraph:
- this is not an item
- neither is this

##### no need for a blank line after last header
- ul 1
- ul 2

but don't do this, it confusing and hard to read.

## example list

### no tag

(@) no tag. a bit useless.

a paragraph

(@) no tag. a bit useless.

must be at start of line to work: (@)

###  tagged

(@tag1) text of tag1

ref to tag1: (@tag1)

(@tag2) text of tag2

ref to tag1: (@tag1)

(@tag1) <-- cannot start line directly with reference. It will be treated as a list item.

# links

header links generated with `--toc` work in latex and html: [links](#links)

links to other internal ids works only in html: [id](#id)

the only non html way I could find to do this was via code block attributes: `` `code`{#id} ``.

## relative link

possible:

[readme.html](readme.html)

[readme.pdf](readme.pdf)

the problem is that you have to give the output extension here (html/pdf)
and AFAIK there is no cross ouptut way to do do this. TODO new feature

also note: relative links only work if all pdfs were downloaded on disk.

# code block

Inline: `*this is inline code*`

Inline backtick: `` ` ``

Inline double backtick: ``` `` ```

Inline with attributes: `a = 1 if True else 2`{#inline-with-attrs .python a="b"}

Indented:

    this is a block
    it can contain many lines

Must have blank line after last paragraph:
    this is not a block
    because it does not have a blank line before last paragraph

Can have a paragraph afterwards without blank line:

    code block
paragraph after code block without blank line. Don't do this tough: it confusing and hard to read.

Delimited code block with tildes:

~~~
import os

def f(a):
    print a

f("abc")
~~~

with backticks:

```
import os

def f(a):
    print a

f("abc")
```

I prefer backticks for analogy with inline blocks. It is less readable tough.

Give attributes:

```{#id .python .numberLines startFrom="100"}
import os

def f(a):
    print a

f("abc")
```

Language shortcut:

~~~python
import os

def f(a):
    print a

f("abc")
~~~

# math

Inline: $x^2$

Firs chars after first dollar and before lats one must not be space: $ x^2$ $x^2 $ $ x^2 $

## latex

is ignored on html output, so don't use it.

$$x^2$$

\begin{equation}
    x^2
\end{equation}

# escaping stuff

\#

\*a*

\[a](b)

\`a`

\```

\```

# html

only works for html output, not for pdf, so never use it unless you really need it and can break pdf.

<p>par</p>

<p>par</p>

<ul>
    <li>item</li>
</ul>

## inner content is md parsed:

<p>**par**</p>

##comments

there is no real good way AFAIK

a good possibility is:

<!-- comment -->
