this dir contains info and cheatsheets for *things* that work in linux, with some focus on the Ubuntu distro.

by *things* I mean:

- programs

- programming languages

- libraries

many of those tools may be cross platform or have very similar ports for other OSs so the info here may also be useful for other OS.
I have not however tested anything in any os except linux.

those tools are kept in this repo because:

- they don't deserve a repo of their own because I don't have enough info written on them.

- it is difficult to say where the tool ends and linux begins.

as such, this is kind of my default repo for small tools that work on Linux and did not fit anywhere else.
