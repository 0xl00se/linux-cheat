How to install a new OS on your computer, especially a GNU Linux one.

#Install a new distro

Most distros are distributed in ISOs suitable to burning on a CD or DVD, from which you can then boot the computer and install them.

It is also possible to put the CD or DVD image in a USB.

Such CDs or USBs are commonly called *Live*, and so is a session in which the OS was loaded from such media.

You can keep in mind that booting from a Live CD means that that CD contains at least the Kernel image so that you load that image into RAM instead of loading it from your HD.

If you are on a read only CD however, you can usually not save any information to the CD while on a live boot, so it makes no sense to save a file to the CD.

You could however mount your hard disk, and write to it after you booted from the CD.

You will need a free partition for the installation.

##USB install

The main parameters to watch for each method are:

- works for whith distribution?
- can be done from which system?
- destroys existing data in USB?
- allows persistent storage?

###From Windows

Pendrive Linux <http://www.pendrivelinux.com> is a very good tool that:

- works for multiple distributions
- can create persistent storate.

From Windows, therea method of USB installation which does not destroy USB data completely.

Some installers even allow you to reserve space on the USB for persistent storage, so that you can use your OS from the USB just as if it were an small and fast HD.

###dd method

Works for any distribution.

Destroys all datat in USB.

No persistent storate.

Inner workings: put the ISO image asbe the very first thing on the USB, therefore erasing essential filesystem structures such as the main boot record partition table of the USB.

Of course, you can always recreate a filesystem in your USB and use it as a storage device once you are done with it.

First find the device for the USB which we will call `/dev/sdX` with:

    sudo lsblk -f

The USB must not be mounted (`lsblk` shows no mountpoint). You can unmount it with:

    sudo umount /path/to/montpoint

To install the image on the USB do:

    sudo dd bs=4M if=/path/to/iso.iso of=/dev/sdX

Where `/dev/sdX` is the mount point of the USB.

This will erase all data on the USB!

*Don't* write to the first partition `/dev/sdX1`, since what we want is to write to the start of the device, not to the start of its first partition!

###usb-creator-gtk

Ubuntu specific.

Allows easy creation of persistent storage USB of up to 4Gb, and more with hacks.

    gksudo usb-creator-gtk

##Bootloader problems

Most distributions install their own bootloader, meaning that they rewrite the existing bootloader.

This means that if the new bootloader cannot recognize certain types of boot data on each partition, you will not see those partitions as bootable.

This is for example the case if you install a distro with GRUB 2 (Ubuntu 13.04), and then install another distro which uses GRUB (Fedora 17)

GRUB cannot recognize GRUB 2 booting data since it came before GRUB 2 existed, so you will not see your old bootable partitions as bootable.

Therefore, if you have the choice, the best option in this case would be to first install the GRUB distro, and only then the GRUB 2 distro, so that in the end you will have GRUB 2, which will see both partitions as bootable.

This can be corrected in 2 ways: from a live boot, or from an existing partition with GRUB 2.

###live boot

If you can Live boot in the distro that uses GRUB 2 things are easy.

Boot with the Live CD, and then simply reinstall the GRUB 2 bootloader, using the GRUB 2 installer that comes with the Live CD, so that on next system start GRUB 2 will be used, and will recognize both GRUB and GRUB 2 partitions.

All that is needed to do this is to issue:

    sudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/grub2/system/mount/point /dev/sdX

Where:

- `/media/grub2/system/mount/point`

    Mount point for you GRUB 2 system.

    You must have mounted it with `mount` before.

    Some distros like Ubuntu's Live CD already mount all possible systems, so you might not need to mount it.

    If that is the case, you can check where you partition is mounted with `sudo mount -l`, and then looking into partitions that have the correct type and listing the files inside candidates to make sure that it is the correct partition.

- `/dev/sdX`

    Device file for the Hard disk you want to install GRUB on.

    Remember that GRUB bootloader is installed at the very start of the entire HD, and not of some partition, so it makes no sense to give a partition device such as `/dev/sda1` or `/dev/sda2`.

###existing GRUB 2 partitions

If you do not have access to a Live CD, you can mount the GRUB 2 partition,
and `chroot` into it, and then reinstall GRUB 2.

It will be just as if you were issuing that command from that partition.

Keep in mind that what GRUB does is simply read its configuration files, and after interpreting those write data to specific points of the HD (Master boot record, at the very beginning of the HD) instructions on how to boot.
