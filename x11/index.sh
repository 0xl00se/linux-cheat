#real name: X Window System

#x11 is a `window system`

#upcoming alternative: wayland
#not yet widely used,
#but plans made for use in Ubuntu

#x11 is only an interface.
#there can be different implementations:
	#`X.org` implentation currently dominates
	#`XFree86` was the dominant prior to 2004
		#it broke glp, and fell into disgrace

##it is an abstraction layer for things like:

	#windows
		#stack access order for alt tab
	#key presses
	#mouse position / presses
	#screen backlight

#it is usually graphic accelerated
#this is why messing with gpu settings may break your desktop =)

##it does not include things like:

	##x display management
		#a graphical login screen
		#choice of window manager
		#some implementations:
			#LightDM (lightweight), ubuntu
			#KDM, kde
			#GDM (gnome) fedora

	##`x window manager`:
		#functions:
			#window switching (alt tab / visible list of open windows)
			#program opening with button clicks
				#dock
				#dash
			#multiple desktops
		#implementations:
			#metacity
			#compiz

	#sound management
		#this has been taken up by several related projects:
			#PulseAudio
			#Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

#it uses a server/client mode
#client and server can be on different machines
	#client:
		#typically programs with a window
		#clients give commands to the xserver and tell it to draw on screen
		#clients respond to input events via callback functions
	#server:
		#creates the image
		#sends inputs events to clients who responds to it via callbacks
		#a server has many displays
		#a display has many screens, one mouse and one keyboard
		#to set the display to use use the DISPLAY var:
			export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0
			DISPLAY=localhost:0.1 firefox & #single commena
				#0.1 means: display 0, screen 1

##higher level apis

	#for higher level APIs, use toolkits:

	#gtk: primarily for x11, but can be cross platform
	#qt

	##gtk

		gtk-demo
			#very nice demo of lots of 2.0 features with easy to see source code

##xorg

	#is the dominant implementation of the x server

	##conf file

			#/etc/X11/xorg.conf-4
			#/etc/X11/xorg.conf
			#/etc/xorg.conf

			#where <cmdline> is specified on the command line at startup
