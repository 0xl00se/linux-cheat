Book formats, viewers and manipulation tools.

A book format is in general a format that can represent multiple images,
text and multiple pages such as pdf, djvu or ps.

Pure image or text formats such as jpeg or tex are not covered here.

#formats

formats that contain image, text, fonts such as pdf or djvu
but not not formats that map directly to bits such as png or jpeg

- ps

    a programming language! can have goto, branch, variables
    levels refer to versions: 1, 2 and 3 exist up to today
    cannot split page by page

- eps:
- djvu:
- mobi: mobipocket company, free format
- rtf: proprietary microsoft

##pdf

Text layers, image layers, each page can be serially downloaded and viewed.

A common viewing library is poppler: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppler_%28software%29>.
It also contains many useful utilities.

PDF fonts can be either found in a renderer path, or be embedded in the document.
The [standard 14 fonts]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format#Standard_Type_1_Fonts_.28Standard_14_Fonts.29)must always be supported.

#viewers

##okular

open at given page of document:

    okular -p 2 a.pdf

single instance:

    okular --unique a.pdf
    okular --unique b.pdf

`a.pdf` is closed, `b.pdf` is opened on same window.

##a2ps

txt to ps

does not work for utf8. For that use [paps][]

    a2ps -o a.ps a.txt

-1: one page per sheet (default is 2)

    a2ps -B -1 -o a.ps a.txt

-B: remove default headers:

    a2ps -B -o a.ps a.txt

--borders=no: no default borders:

    a2ps -B -1 --borders=no -o a.ps a.txt

output to stdout

    a2ps -o - a.txt

##paps

Converts txt to ps.

Works for utf8.

Much better defaults than a2ps.

Outputs to stdout by default, so you want:

    paps a.txt > a.ps

Font:

    paps --font="times 12" a.txt > a.ps

TODO list all fonts?

##ps2pdf

    ps2pdf a.ps

    ps2pdf a.ps out.pdf

read from stdin:

    ps2pdf - a.pdf

out to stdout:

    ps2pdf a.ps -

##pdftk

pdf Tool Kit

large feature set on dealing with pdfs pagewise.

rather non standard command line interface (nothing to do with common POSIX or GNU conventions).

merge two or more pdfs into a new document:

    pdftk 1.pdf 2.pdf 3.pdf cat output 123.pdf

or using handles:

    pdftk A=1.pdf B=2.pdf cat A B output 12.pdf

or using wildcards:

    pdftk *.pdf cat output combined.pdf

slice pdf: get pagets 1 to 7 only:

    pdftk A="$f.pdf" cat A1-7 output "$f.pdf"

select pages from multiple pdfs into a new document:

    pdftk A=one.pdf B=two.pdf cat A1-7 B1-5 A8 output combined.pdf

split pdf into single pages

    pdftk mydoc.pdf burst

get pdf metadata like number of pages:

    pdftk mydoc.pdf dump_data | less

rotate the first page of a pdf to 90 degrees clockwise:

    pdftk in.pdf cat 1E 2-end output out.pdf

rotate an entire pdf document’s pages to 180 degrees:

    pdftk in.pdf cat 1-endS output out.pdf

encrypt a pdf using 128-bit strength (the default) and withhold all permissions (the default):

    pdftk mydoc.pdf output mydoc.128.pdf owner_pw foopass

Same as Above, Except a Password is Required to Open the PDF:

    pdftk mydoc.pdf output mydoc.128.pdf owner_pw foo user_pw baz

Same as Above, Except Printing is Allowed (after the PDF is Open):

    pdftk mydoc.pdf output mydoc.128.pdf owner_pw foo user_pw baz allow printing

Decrypt a PDF:

    pdftk secured.pdf input_pw foopass output unsecured.pdf

Join Two Files, One of Which is Encrypted (the Output is Not Encrypted):

    pdftk A=secured.pdf mydoc.pdf input_pw A=foopass cat output combined.pdf

Uncompress PDF Page Streams for Editing the PDF Code in a Text Editor:

    pdftk mydoc.pdf output mydoc.clear.pdf uncompress

Repair a PDF’s Corrupted XREF Table and Stream Lengths (If Possible):

    pdftk broken.pdf output fixed.pdf

    ddjvu -format=pdf -pages=1,3,99999-4 "$djvu" "$pdf"

loses text layer
