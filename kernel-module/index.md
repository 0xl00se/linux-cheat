there are things which are hard to do from regular user programs such as
directly talking to hardware

some operations can be done via system calls, but if you want flexibility and
speed, using the kernel ring is fundamental

however:

- it would be very complicated to recompile the kernel and reboot every time you make some modification
- the kernel would be huge if it were to support all possible hardware

modules overcome those two problems exactly because they can be loaded into the kernel
*while it is running* and use symbols that the kernel chooses to export TODO which

it then runs in the same address space as the kernel and with the same permissions
as the kernel (basically do anything)

compiled modules are special object files that have a `.ko` extension instead of `.o`
they also contain module specific metadata

device drivers (programs that enables the computer to talk to hardware)
are one specific type of kernel modules

two devices can map to the same hardware!

# config files

if file it gets read, if dir, all files in dir get read:

    sudo ls /etc/modprobe.d
    sudo ls /etc/modprobe.conf

modules loaded at boot:

    sudo cat /etc/modules

# module-init-tools

## package version

from any of the commands, --version

    modinfo --version

package that provides utilities

## lsmod

list loaded kernel modules

info is taken from `/proc/modules`

    lsmod

sample output:

    cfg80211              175574  2 rtlwifi,mac80211
    ^^^^^^^^              ^^^^^^  ^ ^^^^^^^,^^^^^^^^
    1                     2       3 4       5

1. name
2. size
3. numer of running instances
4. depends on
5. depends on

to get more info:

    cat /proc/modules

also contains two more columns:

- status: Live, Loading or Unloading
- memory offset: 0x129b0000

## modinfo

    modinfo a.ko
    modinfo a

get info about a module

## insmod

loads the module
does not check for dependencies

    sudo insmod

## modprobe

list available modules relative path to /lib/modules/VERSION/:

    sudo modprobe -l

load the module:

    sudo modprobe $m

checks for dependencies

load module under different name to avoid conflicts:

    sudo modprobe vmhgfs -o vm_hgfs

remove module

    sudo modprobe -r $m

check if dependencies are ok:

    sudo depmod -a

get info about given `.ko` module file:

    m=a
    sudo rmmod $m

# includes

the default Makefile which is called by the Makefile in this directory automatically
adds `/usr/src/linux-headers-$(CUR_KERNEL_VERSION)/` TODO check

those come directly from the kernel source tree.

# device drivers

    ls -l /dev

there are two types of devices: block and char

    crw-rw----  1 root tty       7,   1 Feb 25 09:29 vcs1
    ^
    c: char

    brw-rw----  1 root disk      8,   0 Feb 25 09:30 sda
    ^
    b: block

this is my hd.
each partition also gets a b file

## major minor numbers

    crw-rw----  1 root tty       7,   1 Feb 25 09:29 vcs1
        ^    ^
        1    2

- 1: major number. tells kernel which driver controls this file
- 2: minor number. id of each hardware controlled by a
    given driveer

## mknod

    sudo mknod /dev/coffee c 12 2

makes a char file, major number 12, minor number 2
