# X11

Real name: X Window System.

X11 is a window system.

It is by far the most commonly used on Linux.

An upcoming alternative is Wayland. It is not yet widely used, but plans made for use in Ubuntu.

X11 is only an interface.

There can be different implementations:

- X.org implementation currently dominates
- XFree86 was the dominant prior to 2004,
    when it adopted BSD license leaving GPL, and fell into oblivion.

X is an abstraction layer for things like:

- windows
- key presses
- mouse position / presses
- screen backlight

X does not:

-   relegates certain jobs to x display managers and x window managers.

-   panel

-   a desktop that shows files contained in some predefined folder. TODO who does that?

-   sound management

    This has been taken up by other projects:

    - PulseAudio
    - Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

Usually graphic accelerated. This is why messing with GPU settings may break your desktop.

X11 uses a server/client mode

Client and server can be on different machines

Client:

- typically programs with a window
- clients give commands to the X server and tell it to draw on screen
- clients respond to input events via callback functions

Server:

-   creates the image

-   sends inputs events to clients who responds to it via callbacks

-   a server has many displays

-   a display has many screens, one mouse and one keyboard

-   to set the display to use use the DISPLAY var:

        env DISPLAY=localhost:0.1 firefox & #single commena

    Display notation: `0.1` means: display 0, screen 1

A good way to see some basic and useful application implemented in pure X as demos
is to do `ls /etc/X11/app-defaults`

## xorg

Dominant implementation of the X server.

Configuration file:

    man xorg.conf

First of:

- `/etc/X11/<cmdline>`
- `/tmp/Xorg-KEM/etc/X11/<cmdline>`
- `/etc/X11/$XORGCONFIG`
- `/tmp/Xorg-KEM/etc/X11/$XORGCONFIG`
- `/etc/X11/xorg.conf-4`
- `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`
- `/etc/xorg.conf`

where `<cmdline>` is specified on the command line at startup

Log file:

    less /var/log/Xorg.0.log

where `0` is the display number.

## X

Get X server version

    sudo X -version

## xhost

View and edit on which users may connect to an X server.

When you start with most desktop environments, they start the host as you.

If you `su another-user`, by default he cannot connect.

View current status:

    xhost

Let any user connect:

    xhost +

Let a single user connect:

    xhost + another-user

## xlsclients

List x clients.

This allows you to see all open windows.

	xlsclients

More detailed info:

	xlsclients -l

## xprop

Get window info on a window

	xprop -name Krusader
	xprop -id 0x2000001

Keep examining the properties, and print if changes happen:

	xprop -spy -name Krusader

## xmodmap

Modify key maps.

For example, to exchange ESC and Caps Lock:

	f=~/.Xmodmap
	echo "! Swap caps lock and escape
    remove Lock = Caps_Lock
    keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
    keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
    add Lock = Caps_Lock
    " >> "$f"
	xmodmap "$f"

To make this happen every time at startup TODO broken?:

	echo "xmodmap \"$f\"
    " >> ~/.xinitrc
	chmod +x ~/.xinitrc

The `~/.xsession` file could also be used depending on system

## xinitrc

Sourced in Ubuntu 12.04, but not 14.04.

## xsessionrc

TODO vs `xinitrc`?

## xdotool

Send clicks and manage window properties from sh.

### select window

Before you try to do things to a window, you must say which window you want to act on.

If you don't give any indication, actions occur on the current window.

Every window has a window id.

Act on windows with given id:

    id=
    xdotool search --window "$id" key ctrl+c

Act on windows with given name:

    n=
    xdotool search --name "$n" key ctrl+c

Name is exactly what is shown on window title bar.

### keystrokes

Keystroke types:

- `key`: up and down
- `keydown`: only down
- `keyup`: only up

Send an `a` keystroke to the current window:

    xdotool key a

Send an `a` keystroke and then a `b` keystroke to the current window:

    xdotool key a b

`F2`:

    xdotool key F2

`รก`:

    xdotool key Aacute

`ctrl+l`:

    xdotool key ctrl+l

Sends `a`, `b`, `space`, `c` and `d`:

    xdotool type 'ab cd'

`a`, waits 1 ms, `b`:

    xdotool type --delay 1 'ab'

### sync

Wait for application to start before sending a command to it:

    google-chrome &
    xdotool search --sync --onlyvisible --class "google-chrome"x-terminal-emulator

In this way, you can launch an app and send commands, making sure they will be received!

## wmctrl

Control windows and get info on them from sh (maximize, minimize, focus, etc.)

Depends on the presence of a window manager.

Very good tutorial: <http://spiralofhope.com/wmctrl-examples.html>

Get info:

- `-d`: desktop info
- `-m`: window manager info

### Window choice

In order to act on a window, one must first select it. The ways to do it are:

-   default (no special option): case insensitive title substring match.

    In case of multiple matches, the first one is chosen.

    E.g.:

        wmctrl -a '- mozilla firefox'

    Will act on a window with title:

        'Google - Mozilla Firefox'

-   `-F`: case sensitive title substring match.

    E.g.:

        wmctrl -Fa '- Mozilla Firefox'

    Will act on a window with title:

        'Google - Mozilla Firefox'

    But not on a window with title:

        'Google - mozilla firefox'

### actions

Once a window is selected, actions can be done on it.

Go to desktop of given window, bring it forward and maximize it:

    wmctrl -a '- mozilla firefox'

Mnemonic: Activate.

Close window:

    wmctrl -c '- mozilla firefox'

Resize and reposition window:

    wmctrl -r '- mozilla firefox' -e 1,0,0,800,600
                                     1 2 3 4   5

`-r` selects the window for commands that already take other arguments such as `-e`

- `1`: gravity TODO
- `2` and `3`: position.
- `4` and `5`: size.

If the window is maximized, this does nothing.

Switch to desktop 1:

    wmctrl -s 1

## keyboard and mouse automation

### AutoKey

High level, GUI interface X11 automation.

## xbacklight

Control screen brightness

Get current lightning level on a scale of 0 to 100:

    xbacklight -get

Set lightning to 80%:

    xbacklight -set 80

## xrandr

Acronym for X Resize, rotate AND Reflect

Gets and sets screen properties such as screen resolution.

    xrandr

Sample output:

    Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1600 x 900, maximum 32767 x 32767
    LVDS1 connected primary 1600x900+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 309mm x 174mm
       1600x900       60.0*+   40.0
       1440x900       59.9
       1360x768       59.8     60.0
       1152x864       60.0
       1024x768       60.0
       800x600        60.3     56.2
       640x480        59.9
    VGA1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    VIRTUAL1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    LVDS-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    VGA-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    DP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    DP-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    DP-3 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)

TODO understand everything on this output.

This output lists the possible resolutions. Mine are: `1600x900` (current because of the `*`, default because of the `+`).

Change resolution:

    xrandr -s 1360x769

the new resolution must be on the list.

Now:

    xrandr

Outputs:

    1600x900       60.0 +   40.0
    1440x900       59.9
    1360x768       59.8*    60.0
    1152x864       60.0
    1024x768       60.0
    800x600        60.3     56.2
    640x480        59.9

So the asterisk `*` gives the new resolution.

Change to default resolution (the one with the plus sign `+`):

    xrandr -s 0

## PRIMARY selection

## CLIPBOARD

## selection

X support an arbitrary number of selections.

The most important ones are widely implemented by default by most GUI systems:

-   `PRIMARY`: automatically updated to the last selected text.

    It can be pasted with a middle click.

-   `CLIPBOARD`: Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V mechanism.

Each selection contains data completely separate from the others.

Those concepts touched by freedesktop.org: <http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/ClipboardsWiki/>

## xclip

Alternative tool to `xsel`.

## xmodmap

View and modify key mappings.

Get a list of current keymapping state:

    xmodmap -pke > ~/.Xmodmap

Sample output line:

    keycode  24 = q Q q Q adiaeresis Adiaeresis
                  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^
                  1 2 3 4 5          6

1. no modifiers
2. shift
3. mode_switch no shift
4. mode_switch +  shift
5. ?
6. ?
7. ?
8. ?
9. ?

**AltGru** is the mode_switch key.

Up to 8 keysyms bay be attached to each keycode.

However, only the first 4 are commonly used.

## setxkblayout
